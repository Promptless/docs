**New Features:**

* **Microsoft Teams Trigger Support:** Full trigger support for Microsoft Teams has been added to Promptless. You can now trigger documentation updates directly from Teams conversations using both direct messages and by tagging our bot in team channels.

* **ClickUp Integration:** Added ClickUp as a new integration, allowing documentation updates to be triggered when tasks are moved to a "ready for production" workflow stage.

* **Custom Voice Documentation:** We've rolled out a fine-tuned model trained based on your docs (public information only). This lets Promptless create doc updates that closely mimics your existing tone and style.

* **Slack File Attachment Processing:** Enhanced Slack integration to process PDFs, text files, CSVs, and other file types. Also add support for extracting images from PDF files to add to documentation.

**Improvements and Bugfixes:**

* Improved explanation and context around the "Remember feedback for future suggestions" feature, providing better guidance on how feedback is processed and applied.

* Fixed an issue where conflict warning notifications could block the reject file modal UI by adjusting modal layering.
