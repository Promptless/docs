**New Features:**

* **MS Teams Trigger Support:** Full trigger support for Microsoft Teams has been added to Promptless. You can now trigger documentation updates directly from Teams conversations using both direct messages and by tagging our bot in team channels.

* **Promptless in your voice:** Promptless can now create fine-tuned models specific to your company's docs voice, so that it's better at matching your existing tone and style. In particular, this means that Promptless sounds less like an AI (e.g. too wordy and technical) and more like your existing docs.

* **Slack File Attachment Processing:** Enhanced Slack integration to process PDFs, text files, CSVs, and other file types. Also add support for extracting images from PDF files to add to documentation.

**Improvements and Bugfixes:**

* Fixed an issue where conflict warning notifications could block the reject file modal UI by adjusting modal layering.
