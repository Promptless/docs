**What's New:**

* **Document360 Integration:** Added Document360 as a new documentation platform integration, allowing you to publish documentation updates directly to the knowledge base.

* **Enhanced Bitbucket Integration:** Improved Bitbucket integration with better connection handling and enhanced pull request processing capabilities.

* **Trigger Directory Configuration:** Added the ability to specify trigger directories for GitHub and Bitbucket integrations. You can now configure Promptless to only monitor specific directories within your repositories, reducing noise and focusing only on relevant code changes.

* **Follow-On Requests in Web Interface:** Introduced follow-on request capabilities directly in the web interface, allowing users to request additional changes without leaving the Promptless dashboard.

* **PR Template Path Configuration:** Added support for configuring custom PR template paths in documentation pipelines, giving teams more control over how Promptless-generated docs PRs are formatted and structured.

**Bug Fixes:**

* **False Positive Reduction:** Implemented improvements to reduce false positive triggers and unnecessary documentation suggestions.

* **Comment Processing:** Improved filtering to prevent irrelevant GitHub comments from triggering documentation updates.
