**New Features:**

* **Discord Integration:** Connect your Discord server to trigger documentation updates from conversations. Mention @Promptless in any channel to request updates, or enable passive listening to automatically monitor specific channels. Promptless can also send notifications about new suggestions to your Discord channels.

* **Notion Integration:** Connect your Notion workspace to use pages and databases as context sources. During OAuth authorization, you select which pages and databases Promptless can access. The dashboard displays content counts (e.g., "8 pages, 2 databases") and includes a refresh button to re-sync workspace content without disconnecting.

* **Configurable GitHub PR Comment Trigger Mode:** Control whether Promptless responds to all PR comments or only @promptless mentions. New organizations listen to all comments by default—start any comment with `aside` or `/aside` to have Promptless skip it. Existing organizations continue to require @promptless mentions. Configure this in Settings → Org Settings.

* **Weekly Suggestion Digest:** Stay on top of documentation reviews with automatic Friday Slack notifications. Each digest summarizes open suggestions awaiting review, shows weekly activity stats (triggers processed, new suggestions), and warns about suggestions approaching the 30-day auto-archive limit. Teams with multiple doc collections receive separate digests per collection.

* **Environment Variables for Agent Credentials:** Store credentials and configuration values that the Promptless agent can use at runtime—like login credentials for screenshot testing or API tokens for authenticated endpoints. Admins can add variables in Settings → Environment Variables, optionally marking them as secrets to hide values after saving. Variables are automatically available to the agent with a `PROMPTLESS_` prefix.

**Improvements:**

* **Paste Images into Task Input:** Paste images directly into the task input box from your clipboard. Take a screenshot (<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>4</kbd> on Mac) and paste it—no need to save to a file first.

* **Clearer Notification Tips:** Notification tips in Slack and GitHub now include direct links to the Promptless dashboard—making it easier to act on labels, assignments, and inline comments.

* **Scoped CI Failure Handling:** When CI checks fail on documentation PRs, Promptless investigates whether the failures are actually caused by the current suggestion—pre-existing or unrelated failures are left alone. If Promptless finds real documentation issues outside the suggestion's scope, it creates a separate suggestion to address them.

* **Smarter Duplicate Detection for GitHub Docs:** Promptless now detects open documentation PRs you've created yourself—if your changes are already covered by an open PR, Promptless skips creating duplicate suggestions and notifies you instead.

* **Markdown Formatting in Slack Messages:** Messages from Promptless in Slack—including questions and clarifications—now render markdown formatting. Links, bold text, headers, and code blocks display properly, making messages easier to read.

* **Excluded Repository Visibility:** Projects configured to trigger on all repositories now clearly display any excluded repos in the project list. When setting up a new project or editing an existing one, you can also use a checkbox to quickly exclude your docs repository from triggers—preventing documentation PRs from triggering Promptless on themselves.

* **Streamlined PR Descriptions:** Documentation PR descriptions now show the first 5 trigger events with a link to the Promptless dashboard for the complete list. This keeps PR descriptions focused and readable for suggestions with many trigger events.
