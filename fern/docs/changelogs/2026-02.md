**New Features:**

* **Discord Integration:** Connect your Discord server to trigger documentation updates from conversations. Mention @Promptless in any channel to request updates, or enable passive listening to automatically monitor specific channels. Promptless can also send notifications about new suggestions to your Discord channels.

**Improvements:**

* **Paste Images into Task Input:** Paste images directly into the task input box from your clipboard. Take a screenshot (<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>4</kbd> on Mac) and paste it—no need to save to a file first.

* **DCO Compliance for Open-Source Projects:** Promptless now automatically adds DCO sign-off to commits on open-source projects. Projects with DCO requirements—like those under the Linux Foundation or CNCF—work with Promptless out of the box.

**Bug Fixes:**

* **Read-Only GitHub App Reliability:** Fixed issues affecting open-source projects using the Read-Only GitHub App integration. PRs from forked repositories now sync correctly when processing follow-on instructions, comments are acknowledged with reactions, PR comments post as expected, citation comments no longer trigger recursive processing loops, and PR context is retrieved correctly.

* **Slack Notification Large Diff Handling:** Fixed Slack notifications failing or getting cut off when suggestions involve many file changes. Notifications now gracefully truncate the file list and show how many additional files were changed, while full details remain available in the attached file.

* **Auto-Merge Documentation PR Reliability:** Fixed auto-merge for documentation PRs failing for GitHub Cloud users. Auto-merge now correctly retrieves authentication credentials for both GitHub Cloud and GitHub Enterprise installations.

* **Conflict Resolution Reliability:** Fixed automatic conflict resolution failing when suggestions have many conflicting files—Promptless now handles large file conflicts without running into message size limits.
