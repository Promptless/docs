**New Features:**

* **Discord Integration:** Connect your Discord server to trigger documentation updates from conversations. Mention @Promptless in any channel to request updates, or enable passive listening to automatically monitor specific channels. Promptless can also send notifications about new suggestions to your Discord channels.

* **Configurable GitHub PR Comment Trigger Mode:** Control whether Promptless responds to all PR comments or only @promptless mentions. New organizations listen to all comments by default—start any comment with `aside` or `/aside` to have Promptless skip it. Existing organizations continue to require @promptless mentions. Configure this in Settings → Org Settings.

* **Weekly Suggestion Digest:** Stay on top of documentation reviews with automatic Friday Slack notifications. Each digest summarizes open suggestions awaiting review, shows weekly activity stats (triggers processed, new suggestions), and warns about suggestions approaching the 30-day auto-archive limit. Teams with multiple doc collections receive separate digests per collection.

**Improvements:**

* **In-Dashboard Calibration Call Booking:** Book a calibration call with the Promptless team directly from the onboarding trial step. Click "Pick a time" to open a calendar modal and schedule a session to review your initial suggestions.

* **Dashboard Editing After PR Creation:** Keep editing suggestions in the dashboard after opening a docs PR—changes sync automatically to your PR branch. Closing a suggestion from the dashboard also closes the associated GitHub PR.

* **Consistent PR Diff Views:** When a suggestion has an open documentation PR, the diff view now shows exactly what GitHub shows on the PR page—keeping both views in sync even as the PR's merge base changes.

* **Trigger Pills in Suggestion Header:** Clickable pills in the suggestion header show the trigger source (like "PR #1882" or "Slack message") with the appropriate icon. Suggestions with multiple triggers show a "+N more triggers" pill. Click any pill to jump to the Triggers & Analysis tab for full details.

* **Research Visibility:** The research summary now shows web search queries and codebase search patterns—including search terms and directories—so you can see how Promptless gathered context for your documentation changes.

* **Paste Images into Task Input:** Paste images directly into the task input box from your clipboard. Take a screenshot (<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>4</kbd> on Mac) and paste it—no need to save to a file first.

* **DCO Compliance for Open-Source Projects:** Promptless now automatically adds DCO sign-off to commits on open-source projects. Projects with DCO requirements—like those under the Linux Foundation or CNCF—work with Promptless out of the box.

* **Follow-Up Comments on Docs PRs:** When you comment on a documentation PR that Promptless opened, your follow-up request updates the existing suggestion instead of starting a new one. This makes it easy to refine suggestions directly from the docs PR conversation.

* **Clearer Notification Tips:** Notification tips in Slack and GitHub now include direct links to the Promptless dashboard—making it easier to act on labels, assignments, and inline comments.

* **Scoped CI Failure Handling:** When CI checks fail on documentation PRs, Promptless investigates whether the failures are actually caused by the current suggestion—pre-existing or unrelated failures are left alone. If Promptless finds real documentation issues outside the suggestion's scope, it creates a separate suggestion to address them.

* **Smarter Duplicate Detection for GitHub Docs:** Promptless now detects open documentation PRs you've created yourself—if your changes are already covered by an open PR, Promptless skips creating duplicate suggestions and notifies you instead.

* **Automatic Dot-File Skipping:** Promptless now skips PRs and merge requests that only contain changes to dot-directories (`.github/`, `.circleci/`, `.beads/`) or root-level dot-files (`.gitignore`, `.editorconfig`)—tooling and CI configuration changes that don't typically need documentation.

* **Accurate Suggestion Timestamps:** Timestamps now reflect when documentation content actually changed, not when metadata was last updated—keeping your suggestion list stable and correctly ordered.

* **Markdown Formatting in Slack Messages:** Messages from Promptless in Slack—including questions and clarifications—now render markdown formatting. Links, bold text, headers, and code blocks display properly, making messages easier to read.

* **Excluded Repository Visibility:** Projects configured to trigger on all repositories now clearly display any excluded repos in the project list. When setting up a new project or editing an existing one, you can also use a checkbox to quickly exclude your docs repository from triggers—preventing documentation PRs from triggering Promptless on themselves.

**Bug Fixes:**

* **Slack Notification Large Diff Handling:** Fixed Slack notifications failing or getting cut off when suggestions involve many file changes. Notifications now gracefully truncate the file list and show how many additional files were changed, while full details remain available in the attached file.

* **Auto-Merge Documentation PR Reliability:** Fixed auto-merge for documentation PRs failing for GitHub Cloud users. Auto-merge now correctly retrieves authentication credentials for both GitHub Cloud and GitHub Enterprise installations.

* **Conflict Resolution Reliability:** Fixed automatic conflict resolution failing when suggestions have many conflicting files—Promptless now handles large file conflicts without running into message size limits.

* **PR Citation Comment Reliability:** Fixed intermittent failures when posting citation comments to documentation PRs. When line-level review comments can't be posted (because the cited line is outside the PR diff), citations now fall back to file-level comments with a line number indicator—so you still see the source references in context.

* **TypeScript and Rust File Display:** Fixed TypeScript (.ts), Rust (.rs), and Emacs Org-mode (.org) files displaying as binary content—these file types now render as readable text when reviewing documentation changes.

* **Dashboard Navigation:** Fixed page flickering when switching between Suggestions, Triggers, New Task, and other dashboard pages.

* **Large Image Processing:** Fixed triggers failing when processing PRs or messages with images larger than 8000 pixels—Promptless now resizes them to fit within API limits.

* **Claude Code Agent Stability:** Fixed an issue where Claude Code agent sessions could exit unexpectedly with a decompression error when processing certain API responses.
