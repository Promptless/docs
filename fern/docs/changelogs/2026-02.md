**New Features:**

* **Discord Integration:** Connect your Discord server to trigger documentation updates from conversations. Mention @Promptless in any channel to request updates, or enable passive listening to automatically monitor specific channels. Promptless can also send notifications about new suggestions to your Discord channels.

* **Configurable GitHub PR Comment Trigger Mode:** Control whether Promptless responds to all PR comments or only @promptless mentions. New organizations listen to all comments by default—start any comment with `aside` or `/aside` to have Promptless skip it. Existing organizations continue to require @promptless mentions. Configure this in Settings → Org Settings.

**Improvements:**

* **Paste Images into Task Input:** Paste images directly into the task input box from your clipboard. Take a screenshot (<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>4</kbd> on Mac) and paste it—no need to save to a file first.

* **DCO Compliance for Open-Source Projects:** Promptless now automatically adds DCO sign-off to commits on open-source projects. Projects with DCO requirements—like those under the Linux Foundation or CNCF—work with Promptless out of the box.

* **Clearer Notification Tips:** Notification tips in Slack and GitHub now include direct links to the Promptless dashboard—making it easier to act on labels, assignments, and inline comments.

* **Scoped CI Failure Handling:** When CI checks fail on documentation PRs, Promptless investigates whether the failures are actually caused by the current suggestion—pre-existing or unrelated failures are left alone. If Promptless finds real documentation issues outside the suggestion's scope, it creates a separate suggestion to address them.

* **Smarter Duplicate Detection for GitHub Docs:** Promptless now detects open documentation PRs you've created yourself—if your changes are already covered by an open PR, Promptless skips creating duplicate suggestions and notifies you instead.

**Bug Fixes:**

* **Slack Notification Large Diff Handling:** Fixed Slack notifications failing or getting cut off when suggestions involve many file changes. Notifications now gracefully truncate the file list and show how many additional files were changed, while full details remain available in the attached file.

* **Auto-Merge Documentation PR Reliability:** Fixed auto-merge for documentation PRs failing for GitHub Cloud users. Auto-merge now correctly retrieves authentication credentials for both GitHub Cloud and GitHub Enterprise installations.

* **Conflict Resolution Reliability:** Fixed automatic conflict resolution failing when suggestions have many conflicting files—Promptless now handles large file conflicts without running into message size limits.

* **PR Citation Comment Reliability:** Fixed intermittent failures when posting citation comments to documentation PRs. When line-level review comments can't be posted due to GitHub API limitations, citations now fall back to regular PR comments—so you still see the source references.

* **TypeScript and Rust File Display:** Fixed TypeScript (.ts), Rust (.rs), and Emacs Org-mode (.org) files displaying as binary content—these file types now render as readable text when reviewing documentation changes.
