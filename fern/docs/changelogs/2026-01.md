**New Features:**

* **Agent Knowledge Base:** View and edit the files that inform how Promptless writes documentation—your style guide, product overview, and documentation guidelines. Find them in Settings under the Agent Knowledge Base tab. Promptless updates these files automatically as it learns from your feedback, but you can also edit them directly.

* **Atlassian Integration (Jira + Confluence):** Connect both Jira and Confluence through a single unified Atlassian integration. Promptless now searches your Confluence spaces alongside Jira tickets—pulling documentation patterns, terminology, and architectural decisions when creating suggestions. This replaces the previous Jira-only integration—if you previously connected Jira, reconnect to access Confluence while preserving your Jira project configuration.

* **Guided Onboarding Wizard:** A 6-step wizard walks new users through Promptless setup: connecting Slack, connecting your documentation platform, configuring triggers, adding context sources, setting agent preferences, and starting your trial. Progress saves automatically—leave and return to pick up where you left off. Team members from the same organization can continue setup without losing previous progress.

* **Automatic Support Channel:** Installing the Promptless Slack app automatically creates a shared Slack Connect channel and sends you an invitation. Accept to get a direct line to the Promptless team for questions and support—no setup required.

* **Self-Service Signup:** Sign up for Promptless at [accounts.gopromptless.ai](https://accounts.gopromptless.ai)—no sales call required.

**Improvements:**

* **Upgraded to Claude Opus 4.5:** Documentation suggestions now use Claude Opus 4.5 for improved reasoning, analysis, and documentation context understanding.
* **Calibration Progress Tracking:** Track your progress in helping Promptless learn your documentation preferences. The new Calibration Progress banner shows how many suggestions you've published and how much feedback you've provided—Promptless uses both to understand your writing style, tone, and standards. The banner appears on all dashboard pages until you reach calibration goals (5 published suggestions and 5 pieces of feedback), then disappears automatically.

* **Ready Count Includes Open PRs:** The Ready count on the Change History page now includes suggestions with open documentation PRs—not just unpublished suggestions. Previously, only suggestions without PRs were counted as ready, so you can now see everything that needs your review in one place.
* **Suggestions Stay Active When Being Reviewed:** Viewing a suggestion now counts as activity—so suggestions you're actively reviewing stay active even if no edits are made for over 30 days. Previously, suggestions would be automatically pruned after 30 days of inactivity. This works alongside the "Viewed" file checkbox added in December for tracking review progress.
* **Faster Suggestion Page Loading:** The Change History page now loads faster. Suggestion metadata—titles, descriptions, and trigger details—appears immediately while the diff loads in parallel.
* **Smarter Screenshot Capture:** Promptless now makes better decisions about when to capture fresh screenshots for documentation. When processing UI changes, Promptless proactively identifies which screenshots need updating and captures fresh, high-quality images from your live product.
* **Screenshot Cropping:** Promptless can now crop screenshots to focus on specific UI elements—highlighting exactly what users need to see without extra clutter.
* **Automatic Suggestion Updates from Main:** When changes are pushed to your documentation's main branch, Promptless merges those updates into all open suggestion branches and automatically resolves any conflicts.
* **Trigger Source Filter:** Filter suggestions on the Change History page by how they were triggered—Slack messages, Web UI requests, or GitHub PRs. For GitHub, expand the dropdown to filter by specific repositories.
* **Estimated Review Time:** Suggestions now display an estimated review time based on lines changed. Sort by "Shortest review" to prioritize quick reviews—useful for clearing small updates first or ramping up new team members.
* **GitHub Repository Help Link:** During onboarding, if you uncheck "Trigger on all repos" and don't see the repositories you need, a help link now points to documentation on adding more repositories to your GitHub App.
* **Slack Installation Pending Flow:** If you don't have admin permissions to install Slack apps, an "Installation Pending" screen shows clear next steps—contact your admin, continue setup without Slack, or try again after approval.
* **Diffs for Closed Suggestions:** View the full diff of any suggestion—even after it's been closed or merged. Previously, diffs were lost once a suggestion's branch was pruned. Promptless now archives diffs before cleanup, so you can always review what changed.
* **PR Replay Slack Notification:** The calibration card now shows that you'll receive a Slack notification when PR replays complete—no need to wait around.
* **Onboarding Trigger Selection:** Removed "Connected" badges from trigger options—integration status now uses checkboxes only, reducing clutter and clarifying when additional setup is still needed.

**Bug Fixes:**

* **Confluence Integration Reliability:** Fixed an issue where Confluence workspace connection data could be lost when refreshing the integration, making Confluence spaces temporarily unavailable.
* **New Task Project Dropdown:** Fixed the New Task feature to only show doc collections that have completed analysis—preventing errors when submitting documentation requests. Previously, users could select doc collections that were still being analyzed, which would fail when submitted.
* **Promptless Capture Reliability:** Fixed intermittent failures when capturing screenshots.
* **Citation Display in Editor:** Fixed citation icons overlapping when multiple citations reference the same line—they now stack properly for easier viewing.
* **Citation Popup Positioning:** Fixed citation popup positioning and arrow placement issues in the editor, ensuring popups display correctly even when citations are stacked.
* **Comment Bubble Overflow:** Fixed comment bubbles extending beyond the editor viewport, keeping all interface elements properly contained within the editing area.
* **Cleaner Suggestion Diffs:** Fixed suggestion diffs to exclude internal system files—diffs now show only your documentation changes, making them easier to review.
* **Slack Notification Diff Files:** Fixed diff file attachments in Slack notifications—teams can now see the full diff of documentation changes directly from Slack without needing to open the PR or web interface.
* **Git Sync Reliability:** Improved reliability of git sync operations when Promptless pushes documentation changes—sync operations now properly wait for concurrent git processes to complete, preventing intermittent failures.
* **Git Repository Access Reliability:** Fixed intermittent failures from git configuration lock contention when processing multiple documentation updates simultaneously.
* **GitHub PR Processing:** Improved reliability when processing GitHub PRs with many file changes—Promptless now handles large PRs with multiple files more consistently, preventing intermittent errors during analysis.
* **Background Job Processing:** Improved reliability of background job processing—jobs now properly initialize cache clients, preventing intermittent failures during documentation generation.
* **Suggestion Tracking with Multiple Doc Collections:** Fixed suggestion tracking with multiple doc collections—trigger events now link to the correct suggestions. Previously, when multiple agents responded to the same trigger (like a Slack message) but used different doc collections, trigger events could link to the wrong suggestion.
* **Change History Page Performance:** Improved performance and reliability of the Change History page when viewing suggestions—page updates now happen more efficiently to ensure consistent functionality.
* **Impacted File List Accuracy:** Suggestion diffs now show only documentation files—internal Promptless system files no longer appear in the impacted files list, making it easier to see exactly which documentation files changed.
* **Re-opened Docs PRs Now Resume Correctly:** Re-opening a docs PR now restores the suggestion so you can continue editing. Previously, follow-on instructions weren't processed after closing and re-opening a PR.
* **Suggestion Editing Reliability:** Fixed an issue where editing existing suggestions could fail—the system was incorrectly looking for suggestion branches in the wrong storage location.
* **Internal Evaluation Infrastructure:** Fixed inconsistent default resource configurations in the evals system—resource defaults are now maintained in a single authoritative location, improving reliability of internal evaluation runs.
* **Suggestion Stability for Revert PRs:** Fixed an issue where suggestions could be incorrectly deleted when processing PRs that revert previously documented changes—suggestions now remain active and continue receiving updates correctly.
* **PR Replay Status Accuracy:** Fixed PR replays to show the correct PR status on the Triggers page. Previously, replayed PRs always showed "open" status regardless of whether the PR was actually merged, closed, or in draft state.
* **GitHub Trigger Icons:** Fixed the Change History page to show the GitHub icon for all GitHub-based triggers—including GitHub Enterprise PRs, merged PRs, and GitHub Issues. Previously, the icon only appeared for regular open PRs.
* **GitHub PR Event Filtering:** Fixed an issue where Promptless could trigger on PR events like `edited` or `synchronize` instead of only triggering when PRs are opened, marked ready for review, or reopened.
* **Large Image Processing:** Fixed failures when processing triggers with large images. Promptless now automatically compresses images that exceed size limits, so you can include high-resolution screenshots and images in Slack messages, GitHub issues, or other triggers without issues.
* **Documentation PR Update Reliability:** Fixed intermittent failures when updating documentation PRs with new changes. Promptless now handles transient GitHub API timing issues more gracefully, ensuring suggestions are consistently applied to your docs PRs.
* **Onboarding Integration Setup:** Fixed an issue where connecting integrations (like Slack or GitHub) during onboarding could fail due to blocked OAuth callback URLs.
* **Onboarding Wizard Progress:** Fixed an issue where progress wasn't saved when returning to the onboarding wizard immediately after connecting Slack.
* **Onboarding Trigger Dropdowns:** Fixed the trigger configuration step to show your actual repositories and Slack channels in the selection dropdowns. Previously, the dropdowns displayed placeholder data instead of your connected integrations.
* **Onboarding Agent Preferences:** Fixed an issue where agent preferences configured during onboarding weren't being saved—agent behavior and beta feature selections now persist correctly.
* **Onboarding Pipeline Creation:** Fixed 500 errors that could occur when completing the onboarding wizard's context sources step.
* **Onboarding Wizard Visual Smoothness:** Fixed visual flickering in the onboarding wizard during OAuth callbacks—the wizard now shows a loading spinner instead of briefly flashing incorrect content.
* **Onboarding Preferences Layout:** Fixed the Next button position jumping between preference questions with different numbers of options—the button now stays in a consistent position.
* **Onboarding Slack Connect Button:** Fixed the Slack Connect button appearing greyed out when navigating back to the onboarding wizard after starting but not completing OAuth.
* **Slack Connect Channel Visibility:** Fixed an issue where Slack Connect support channels were created as private in your workspace—support channels now appear as public, so you can invite other team members from your organization.
* **High-Volume Trigger Processing:** Fixed intermittent errors when processing triggers for organizations with many concurrent documentation tasks.
* **Onboarding Calibration Card Display:** Fixed misleading spinners on the trial page calibration card—the "Building product ontology" step now shows a checkmark since it completes instantly. The PR replay section now only appears when there are PRs to replay.
