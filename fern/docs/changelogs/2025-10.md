**What's New:**

* **Manual Documentation Requests from Dashboard:** You can now request documentation updates directly from the dashboard using the new "New Task" button. Select a project, write your instructions (like "Check our docs for broken links and fix them"), and submit. Promptless creates suggestions based on your request, just like Slack DMs but from the dashboard. This is especially helpful for open-source projects or teams without Slack integration.

* **Research Visibility in Change Timeline:** The Change Timeline now shows exactly what Promptless reviewed before making documentation updates—see which files, webpages, Slack conversations, and other sources were analyzed. Click "Show details" to expand the full list with direct links to each source. This makes it easy to verify the context behind changes and spot if important sources were missed. Source descriptions are now more precise—GitHub PRs appear as "Reviewed Promptless/promptless#123" instead of generic "Read webpage from github.com", and the same clarity applies to GitLab MRs, Bitbucket PRs, and Jira issues.

* **Triggers Page:** The new Triggers page helps you verify that Promptless ran on the PRs and events you expect it to. When Promptless doesn't create suggestions, you can see exactly why—check the full research and context Promptless reviewed for any trigger from the last 30 days. Filter by trigger type (GitHub PRs, Slack messages, support tickets, etc.) or suggestion status to quickly find what you're looking for.

* **Multiple GitHub Organization Support:** You can now connect multiple GitHub organizations to a single Promptless account. Each organization shows up as its own card in the integrations page with its own repository list and management controls. When creating or editing projects, select your GitHub organization from the dropdown (e.g., "Github (Promptless)"), then choose from that organization's repositories. Work across multiple organizations or manage both company and personal projects in one place.

* **Non-Blocking Feedback:** When you remember feedback for future suggestions without requesting changes to the current one, you can keep viewing and interacting with the suggestion right away. Previously, the interface would block while processing feedback—even when nothing was being changed.

* **Slack Passive Channel Listening:** Promptless can now automatically monitor specific Slack channels and create documentation suggestions when conversations go quiet for 10 minutes. This opt-in feature lets you select which channels to monitor and add or remove channels at any time. Set it up in your project configuration by checking "Listen for all messages in specific channels" and selecting your desired channels. For more details, see [Working with Slack](/docs/features/slack-interactions#4-passive-channel-listening).

* **Slack Private Channel Support:** Promptless now works properly in private Slack channels when invited, fixing previous permission issues.

* **Descriptive Commit Messages:** Promptless PRs now use the suggestion title as the commit message instead of generic "Documentation updates from Promptless" text. This keeps your git history more informative and easier to track—especially helpful if you don't use squash-merge.
