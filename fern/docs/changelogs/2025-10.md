**What's New:**

* **Manual Documentation Requests from Dashboard:** Request documentation updates directly from the dashboard using the "New Task" button. Select a project, write your instructions, and submit—just like Slack DMs but from the dashboard.

* **Research Visibility in Change Timeline:** The Change Timeline now shows exactly what Promptless reviewed—files, webpages, Slack conversations, and other sources. Click "Show details" for the full list with direct links. Source descriptions are more precise—GitHub PRs appear as "Reviewed Promptless/promptless#123" instead of generic "Read webpage from github.com".

* **Triggers Page:** Verify that Promptless ran on expected PRs and events. When Promptless doesn't create suggestions, see exactly why. View research and context for any trigger from the last 30 days, with filters for trigger type and suggestion status.

* **Multiple GitHub Organization Support:** Connect multiple GitHub organizations to a single Promptless account. Each org appears as its own card with separate repository lists. Manage company and personal projects in one place.

* **Non-Blocking Feedback:** When you remember feedback for future suggestions without requesting changes to the current one, you can keep viewing and interacting with the suggestion right away. Previously, the interface would block while processing feedback—even when nothing was being changed.

* **Slack Passive Channel Listening:** Automatically monitor specific Slack channels and create documentation suggestions when conversations go quiet for 10 minutes. This opt-in feature lets you select which channels to monitor.

* **Slack Private Channel Support:** Promptless now works properly in private Slack channels when invited, fixing previous permission issues.

* **Descriptive Commit Messages:** Promptless PRs now use the suggestion title as the commit message instead of generic "Documentation updates from Promptless" text. This keeps your git history more informative and easier to track—especially helpful if you don't use squash-merge.
