### February 2025

**What's New:**

* **Intercom Integration (beta):** Added Intercom integration allowing Promptless to publish doc updates directly to Intercom help centers. Users can also trigger documentation updates from Intercom support conversations that could indicate documentation gaps.

* **Paligo Support:** Integration with Paligo (beta), a documentation platform, enables Promptless to work with XML-based documentation workflows and enterprise content management systems.

* **Enhanced GitHub PR Editing:** Added the ability for users to edit documentation changes further through GitHub comments on documentation PRs. This allows for iterative refinement of the generated suggestions directly within the GitHub workflow.

* **Slack Notification System:** Added Slack notifications to keep teams informed about documentation updates and processing status. Added support for notifications to specific channels and improved visibility into Promptless activities.
