**Improvements:**

* **Claude Sonnet 4.5 Model Upgrade:** Promptless now uses Claude Sonnet 4.5 for all organizations, delivering improved documentation quality and more accurate technical writing. Previously limited to pilot organizations, this upgrade ensures everyone benefits from the latest AI model capabilities.

* **Enhanced Slack Context Understanding:** Promptless agents now analyze full Slack conversations instead of individual messages when creating documentation updates. When you share a Slack message URL, Promptless can now see the surrounding discussion to better understand context, decisions, and team conversations. This leads to more accurate and comprehensive documentation that captures the complete story behind your team's discussions.

* **Enhanced GitHub PR Comment Context Awareness:** When you tag Promptless in individual GitHub PR comments, it now automatically reads all previous comments in the PR to understand the full context. This means you can use simple instructions like "Same here" or "Apply this change to the other section too" without having to repeat the full context. Previously, single comments couldn't reference other comments, requiring you to spell out instructions completely or use PR reviews for contextual feedback. This improvement makes it faster and easier to provide follow-on instructions directly in PR comment threads.

* **GitBook Platform Support:** Promptless now supports GitBook as a first-class documentation hosting provider. Teams using GitBook can connect their repositories to automatically update their GitBook documentation when code changes are made. This expands Promptless support to include GitBook alongside existing platforms like Fern, Mintlify, and Docusaurus, making it easy for GitBook users to maintain up-to-date documentation through automated workflows.

* **Improved Jira Context Integration:** Promptless now more reliably fetches Jira ticket information when issues are mentioned in pull requests or trigger events. When a Jira ticket ID appears in a PR description or comments, Promptless consistently retrieves the full ticket context including descriptions, comments, and related issues. This ensures documentation updates have complete context from your Jira workflow, leading to more accurate and comprehensive documentation that reflects the full scope of your work.

* **Automated CI Check and Build Issue Resolution for Documentation PRs:** Promptless now automatically detects and fixes quality issues in documentation pull requests. When linters fail, Vale rules trigger warnings, or documentation hosting providers report broken links or build errors, Promptless automatically analyzes the issues and pushes fixes to the PR branch. This eliminates manual intervention for common quality problems and maintains documentation standards without interrupting your workflow. Quality issues are resolved seamlessly in the background, allowing teams to focus on content rather than troubleshooting technical problems.

* **Smart Draft State Management for Documentation PRs:** Documentation PRs now open as drafts when the source code PR hasn't merged yet, then automatically switch to "Ready for Review" once the source PR merges. This means your team only reviews documentation changes after the underlying code is finalized.

* **Improved Dashboard Synchronization for Follow-on Suggestions:** The dashboard now immediately reflects changes when you make follow-on suggestions to documentation. Previously, there could be delays where the dashboard wouldn't show your latest follow-on edits right away. This improvement ensures that when you refine suggestions through follow-on instructions, the dashboard instantly updates to show your changes, providing better real-time visibility into your documentation workflow.

* **PR Open Status Filter:** You can now filter for suggestions published as pull requests directly from the status dropdown. Previously, you had to manually type `is:pr_open` into the search bar. The "PR Open" option appears alongside "Ready," "Published," and "Rejected."
