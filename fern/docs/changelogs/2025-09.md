**Improvements:**

* **Enhanced Slack Context Understanding:** Promptless agents now analyze full Slack conversations instead of individual messages when creating documentation updates. When you share a Slack message URL, Promptless can now see the surrounding discussion to better understand context, decisions, and team conversations. This leads to more accurate and comprehensive documentation that captures the complete story behind your team's discussions.

* **GitBook Platform Support:** Promptless now supports GitBook as a first-class documentation hosting provider. Teams using GitBook can connect their repositories to automatically update their GitBook documentation when code changes are made. This expands Promptless support to include GitBook alongside existing platforms like Fern, Mintlify, and Docusaurus, making it easy for GitBook users to maintain up-to-date documentation through automated workflows.

* **Automated CI Check and Build Issue Resolution for Documentation PRs:** Promptless now automatically detects and fixes quality issues in documentation pull requests. When linters fail, Vale rules trigger warnings, or documentation hosting providers report broken links or build errors, Promptless automatically analyzes the issues and pushes fixes to the PR branch. This eliminates manual intervention for common quality problems and maintains documentation standards without interrupting your workflow. Quality issues are resolved seamlessly in the background, allowing teams to focus on content rather than troubleshooting technical problems.

* **Improved Dashboard Synchronization for Follow-on Suggestions:** The dashboard now immediately reflects changes when you make follow-on suggestions to documentation. Previously, there could be delays where the dashboard wouldn't show your latest follow-on edits right away. This improvement ensures that when you refine suggestions through follow-on instructions, the dashboard instantly updates to show your changes, providing better real-time visibility into your documentation workflow.
