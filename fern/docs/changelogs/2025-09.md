**Improvements:**

* **Enhanced Slack Context Understanding:** Promptless agents now analyze full Slack conversations instead of individual messages when creating documentation updates. When you share a Slack message URL, Promptless can now see the surrounding discussion to better understand context, decisions, and team conversations. Additionally, Promptless now properly handles external application bots (showing their actual names instead of "Unknown User") and captures complete message content including block-style formatting that was previously missed. This leads to more accurate and comprehensive documentation that captures the complete story behind your team's discussions.

* **GitBook Platform Support:** Promptless now supports GitBook as a first-class documentation hosting provider. Teams using GitBook can connect their repositories to automatically update their GitBook documentation when code changes are made. This expands Promptless support to include GitBook alongside existing platforms like Fern, Mintlify, and Docusaurus, making it easy for GitBook users to maintain up-to-date documentation through automated workflows.

* **Smart Draft PR Management:** Promptless now intelligently manages the status of documentation PRs based on the state of source code changes. When you trigger documentation updates from unmerged PRs, Promptless automatically opens documentation PRs as drafts to prevent premature reviews of documentation for unreleased features. Once the source PR merges, Promptless automatically promotes the documentation PR to "ready for review" status, ensuring your documentation review process aligns perfectly with your development workflow.

* **Improved MS Teams Notification System:** Enhanced MS Teams integration reliability to ensure users receive immediate acknowledgment messages when triggering Promptless. Previously, users might not receive feedback like "Promptless is hard at work, please wait a few minutes for the results" due to async handling issues, potentially causing confusion about whether their request was being processed. This fix ensures consistent communication and reduces user uncertainty when working with Promptless in MS Teams.
