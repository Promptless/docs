**Improvements:**

* **Enhanced Slack Context Understanding:** Promptless agents now analyze full Slack conversations instead of individual messages when creating documentation updates. When you share a Slack message URL, Promptless can now see the surrounding discussion to better understand context, decisions, and team conversations. Additionally, Promptless now properly handles external application bots (showing their actual names instead of "Unknown User") and captures complete message content including block-style formatting that was previously missed. This leads to more accurate and comprehensive documentation that captures the complete story behind your team's discussions.

* **GitBook Platform Support:** Promptless now supports GitBook as a first-class documentation hosting provider. Teams using GitBook can connect their repositories to automatically update their GitBook documentation when code changes are made. This expands Promptless support to include GitBook alongside existing platforms like Fern, Mintlify, and Docusaurus, making it easy for GitBook users to maintain up-to-date documentation through automated workflows.

* **Smart Draft PR Management:** Promptless now intelligently manages the status of documentation PRs based on the state of source code changes. When you trigger documentation updates from unmerged PRs, Promptless automatically opens documentation PRs as drafts to prevent premature reviews of documentation for unreleased features. Once the source PR merges, Promptless automatically promotes the documentation PR to "ready for review" status, ensuring your documentation review process aligns perfectly with your development workflow.

* **PR Comment Transparency:** When Promptless makes changes to your documentation PRs in response to your feedback, it now automatically adds a comment showing exactly what it did. These transparency comments include the specific commit SHA (shortened to 7 characters) where the changes were made, making it easy to track and verify exactly what updates were made. This provides a complete audit trail and eliminates any guesswork about whether your feedback was processed, ensuring full transparency in the documentation workflow.
