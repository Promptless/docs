**New Features:**

* **Persistent File Viewed Status:** The Change History page now includes a persistent "Viewed" status for each file, similar to GitHub's PR file review system. Mark files as viewed after reviewing them to track your progress through documentation suggestions. Viewed files automatically hide the diff editor to reduce clutter, and your viewed status is saved across sessions and synced with team members. Files are automatically marked as viewed when rejected.

**New Features:**

* **PR Replay for New GitHub Projects:** When creating a new GitHub project, you can now enable "Process last 30 days of PRs after project creation" to automatically replay recent pull requests. This feature processes all GitHub PRs from the past 30 days in your selected repositories, generating documentation suggestions for changes that would have triggered Promptless. This is particularly useful during initial setup to catch up on recent development activity and ensure your documentation reflects recent code changes.

**New Features:**

* **All Repos Trigger Option:** You can now configure GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket projects to automatically trigger on all accessible repositories by checking the "Trigger on all repos" option. This eliminates the need to manually select individual repositories and automatically includes future repositories as they're added to your organization.

**Improvements:**

* **Enhanced PR Review Workflow:** When you submit a "Request changes" review on a Promptless-created GitHub pull request, Promptless now automatically processes all comments in that review, even without `@Promptless` mentions. This streamlines the feedback process and makes it more intuitive to iterate on documentation changes during the review workflow.

* **Improved GitHub Comment Interactions:** Promptless now provides better visual feedback and response formatting when you comment on pull requests:
  - Immediately reacts with ðŸ‘€ emoji to show it's processing your comment
  - Creates threaded replies directly to PR review comments instead of top-level comments
  - Mentions you directly in responses with clear status updates and commit information
