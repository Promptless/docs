## New Features

* **Asynchronous Pipeline Loading:** Improved project setup times by implementing background pipeline loading. This reduces waiting time during initial project configuration.

* **Destination Directory Selection:** You can now specify exactly which directories within the repo the doc updates should go to. This feature makes it easy for monorepo structures with a /docs directory.

## Improvements

* **Large File Processing:** Improved handling large documents with intelligent file chunking. The system now processes files in manageable segments while preserving full context, resulting in faster processing times and more accurate results for complex codebases.

## Infrastructure

* **Vector Database Migration:** We've migrated from Pinecone to pgvector for our search infrastructure. This upgrade removes previous limitations around prefix querying and metadata length restrictions.
