## New Features

* **Asynchronous Pipeline Loading:** Improved user experience by implementing asynchronous initial loading for new pipelines, reducing wait times during project setup.

* **Destination Directory Selection:** Enhanced project setup with UI controls for selecting destination directories, providing more granular control over where documentation updates are published within your repositories.

## Improvements

* **Chunked File Analysis:** Enhanced documentation generation by implementing intelligent file chunking for large documents. The system now analyzes files in smaller, manageable chunks while maintaining full context during generation, improving processing efficiency and accuracy for complex codebases.

## Infrastructure

* **Vector Database Migration:** Migrated from Pinecone to pgvector for improved performance and capabilities. This change removes previous limitations around prefix querying and metadata length restrictions, enabling more sophisticated documentation search and retrieval.

* **Automatic Vector Sync:** New projects now automatically trigger vector database synchronization during creation, ensuring documentation indexing is immediately available.
