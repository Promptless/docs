**What's New:**

* **Rich Slack Notifications for Quick Review and Publishing:** When Promptless creates documentation suggestions, you get rich notifications in Slack showing the suggestion title, description, assigned team members, trigger source, and files changed. Use the "Publish" button to merge small, straightforward suggestions directly from Slack, or click "View PR" to review changes in detail on GitHub or in the Promptless dashboard.

* **File Attachment Support for Manual Triggers:** Attach up to 5 files (10 MB max each) when creating manual documentation requests from the dashboard's "New Task" button. Upload screenshots, PDFs, or documents to provide additional context. Like Slack's image processing, attached images and PDFs are automatically analyzed to inform documentation suggestions.
