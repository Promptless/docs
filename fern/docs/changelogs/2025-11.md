**What's New:**

* **Rich Slack Notifications for Quick Review and Publishing:** When Promptless creates documentation suggestions, you get rich notifications in Slack showing the suggestion title, description, assigned team members, trigger source, and files changed. Use the "Publish" button to merge small, straightforward suggestions directly from Slack, or click "View PR" to review changes in detail on GitHub or in the Promptless dashboard.
