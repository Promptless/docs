## What's New

* **Google Drive Integration:** Added Google Drive as a context source with OAuth authentication, allowing Promptless to access and analyze documents stored in Google Drive when generating documentation updates. Users can now connect multiple Google Drive directories to their projects for enhanced contextual information.

* **GitHub Issues RAG Support:** Promptless now automatically queries GitHub issues to provide better context for documentation updates. The system intelligently handles forked repositories by using issues from the source repository and requires no additional configuration when GitHub issues are enabled.

* **Multiple Context Sources:** Enhanced project configuration to support multiple context sources per project, including multiple Google Drive directories and Jira projects for comprehensive documentation context.

* **Keyword Search:** Added keyword search functionality to improve content discovery and documentation generation accuracy.
