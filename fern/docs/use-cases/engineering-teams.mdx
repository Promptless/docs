description: Keep documentation in sync with code changes by automatically generating updates from pull requests
---

Promptless monitors your pull requests. When code changes, it generates documentation updates using PR descriptions and context from Linear or Jira.

## What Promptless Analyzes

This is EDIT!!!!

When a PR is opened, Promptless reviews:
- The code diff and changed files
- The PR title and description
- Related issues in Linear or Jira
- Historical patterns in your documentation

## Publishing Modes

**Auto-publish mode**: Promptless creates a docs PR linked to your source PR. When your PR merges, the docs PR is ready for review.

**Draft mode**: Review suggestions in the web interface before any PR is created.

## Providing Feedback

Tag @Promptless in GitHub PR comments to request changes. Promptless updates the suggestion accordingly.

## Typical Workflow

1. Engineer opens a PR with code changes
2. Promptless analyzes the PR and related context
3. Promptless generates a documentation suggestion
4. Team gets notified in Slack
5. Reviewers provide feedback via PR comments or web interface
6. Documentation publishes when approved
