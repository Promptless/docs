description: Focus on documentation strategy while Promptless handles routine updates and keeps you informed about product changes
---

Promptless handles routine documentation work so you can focus on information architecture and strategy. Instead of attending standups and chasing engineers for context, you get notified when docs need updating—with all the context you need in one place.

## HOW PROMPTLESS HELPS

Promptless monitors your configured trigger sources and notifies you when documentation updates are needed. You receive notifications in a dedicated Slack channel whenever Promptless detects documentation-worthy changes.

### CONTEXT AT A GLANCE

When reviewing a suggestion, you see:
- The PR or trigger that initiated the update
- Related Linear or Jira issues
- Relevant Slack conversations
- The proposed documentation changes

### PROVIDE FEEDBACK

Use the web interface to:
- Highlight text and add comments
- Request changes that Promptless applies automatically
- Save feedback preferences for future suggestions (e.g., "always include code examples for API endpoints")

### AUDIT TRAIL

The Triggers page shows all events from the last 30 days. Track what triggered each documentation update and audit your process.

## TYPICAL WORKFLOW

1. Promptless monitors PRs, Slack, and other triggers
2. You receive a notification when docs need updating
3. Review the suggestion and related context in the web interface
4. Provide feedback to refine the suggestion
5. Approve and publish when ready

## GETTING STARTED

1. Connect your documentation platform via [GitHub](/docs/integrations/github-integration) or another doc collection
2. Create a project with your preferred triggers
3. Set up a dedicated Slack channel for notifications
4. Connect context sources like [Linear](/docs/integrations/linear-integration) or [Jira](/docs/integrations/atlassian-integration)
