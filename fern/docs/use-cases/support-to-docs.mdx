description: Automatically identify documentation gaps from support tickets and generate content that helps future customers
---

Resolved support tickets contain valuable knowledge—troubleshooting steps, workarounds, and explanations that could help future customers. Promptless analyzes your Zendesk tickets to identify documentation gaps and generate content based on solutions your team already provides.

## WHAT PROMPTLESS DOES

When a ticket is resolved, Promptless:

- Identifies patterns across similar tickets
- Detects topics missing from your documentation
- Extracts solutions and troubleshooting steps
- Drafts troubleshooting guides, FAQ entries, and feature explanations

## PUBLISHING OPTIONS

Promptless can publish directly to:

- Zendesk help centers
- Intercom help content (Beta)
- Any documentation platform connected to your project

## TYPICAL WORKFLOW

1. Support team resolves a ticket
2. Promptless analyzes the ticket and related context
3. If documentation should be updated, a suggestion is generated
4. A technical writer or support lead reviews and approves
5. Content publishes to your help center
