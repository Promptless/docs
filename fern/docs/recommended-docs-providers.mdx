# Recommended Documentation Providers

Promptless works with all major documentation platforms. Here are the providers we recommend based on different team needs and use cases.

## Popular Documentation Platforms

| Provider | Price Range | Example Promptless Customer | Best For |
|----------|-------------|-----------------------------|----------|
| Docusaurus | Free (open source) | [Temporal](https://docs.temporal.io/) | Teams with engineering resources that want rich customization |
| Fern | $400+/mo | [Vellum](https://docs.vellum.ai/) | Teams that want a premium offering with API-first support and interactivity |
| Mintlify | Free - $250+/month | [RunPod](https://docs.runpod.io/) | Startups and growing teams wanting modern, beautiful docs and quick setup |
| ReadMe | $79+/month | [Capillary Technologies](https://docs.capillarytech.com/) | API platforms prioritizing interactive developer experience without needs for previewing doc suggestions |
| GitBook | $77+/month | [Emporix](https://developer.emporix.io) | Simpler products without needs for previewing doc suggestions |

<Warning>
GitBook and ReadMe have technical limitations that prevent Promptless from generating live previews of documentation suggestions. You can still receive documentation updates with these providers, but you won't be able to preview changes before they're published. If live preview functionality is important for your team's review process, consider using Fern, Mintlify, or Docusaurus instead.
</Warning>

## Finding the Right Provider for Your Team

When evaluating documentation platforms, the key factors to consider are:

- **Hosting**: Self-hosted (Docusaurus) vs. managed platforms
- **API documentation**: Auto-generation from OpenAPI specs vs. manual authoring
- **Collaboration**: Real-time editing features and user limits for your team size
- **Customization**: Complete control vs. pre-built themes
- **Budget**: Free open source vs. paid managed services
- **Developer experience**: Interactive API playground, code samples, and testing tools

<Tip>
Promptless works with all of these platforms. If you're using GitHub-synced docs (Fern, Mintlify, Docusaurus), Promptless can automatically create PRs with documentation updates. For hosted platforms like ReadMe and Zendesk, Promptless can publish updates directly.
