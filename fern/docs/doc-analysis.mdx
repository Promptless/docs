title: How Promptless Learns Your Docs
---

Before creating the first suggestion, Promptless analyzes your existing docs to understand the product, writing style, and how your docs are organized.

## Initial Ingestion

When you first connect your documentation platform, Promptless ingests and indexes all your existing docs. This typically takes 5-30 minutes, depending on the size of your documentation.

During ingestion, Promptless:

- Reads every page in your connected documentation
- Builds a searchable index to find relevant content when analyzing triggers
- Maps relationships between pages, sections, and topics

## Product Ontology

Promptless builds an understanding of your product's structure—what features you have, how they relate to each other, and the terminology your team uses. This **product ontology** helps Promptless:

- Know which documentation pages are relevant when a specific feature changes
- Understand your product's concepts and terminology
- Identify connections between features that might require coordinated documentation updates

For example, if your product has a "Workspaces" feature with sub-features like "Permissions" and "Invitations," Promptless understands these relationships and can update all relevant pages when workspace behavior changes.

## Voice and Style Learning

Promptless analyzes how your documentation is written—tone, sentence structure, formatting patterns, and terminology choices. This powers **Voice Match**, ensuring suggestions sound like they were written by your team.

Promptless learns patterns like:

- Whether you write formally or conversationally
- The specific words and phrases you use for concepts
- How you organize content, use headings, and format examples
- Your preferences for capitalization, punctuation, and code formatting

When drafting content, Promptless references similar existing pages to match their style.

## What Happens When a Trigger Fires

When an event triggers Promptless (like a PR merge or Slack message), here's what happens:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Context gathering">
    Promptless pulls relevant context from connected sources—PR details, linked issues in Linear or Jira, related Slack conversations, and your existing documentation.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Change analysis">
    Promptless analyzes what changed and determines which parts of your documentation might be affected. This uses the product ontology to identify related features and pages.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Content drafting">
    Using Voice Match, Promptless drafts documentation updates that match your existing style. Every change includes citations showing where the information came from.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Suggestion creation">
    Promptless creates a suggestion for your review. You can edit, provide feedback, or publish directly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Continuous Learning

Promptless continues learning as you use it. When you edit suggestions or provide feedback, Promptless learns your preferences for future suggestions. As your documentation grows and changes, Promptless adapts to your evolving style and automatically re-indexes when you publish updates to stay current.
