In January 2025, we started wondering what would happen if we gave our AI agent a tool to tell us when something was going wrong. This wasn't a common design pattern at the time, but a year later, it has surfaced dozens of hidden bugs and, unexpectedly, given us real empathy for agent suffering that now shapes how we build Promptless.

So, what happens when you let your agent scream? Here's one of my favorite (most painful) examples:

```
*screenshot agent is having a bad time :(*
Severity: high
Concern: I've been attempting to log in to the app for over 60 browser interactions,
but the email input field doesn't seem to accept text input...
```

## Some background

Promptless is an AI agent that automatically updates customer-facing docs. It connects to GitHub, Slack, Jira, Linear, and other tools, coordinating multiple subagents to produce documentation updates. There's ample opportunity for things to go wrong.

We have error tracking/reporting for software issues, but agents fail in ways that don't show up in normal observability. A tool might be misconfigured, the agent might encounter contradictory instructions, or it might find a state that shouldn't exist. The agent will typically retry forever, hallucinate a workaround, or silently give up. Even when it successfully found a workaround, it would bury real issues under the rug that would cause a real failure in a future trajectory. These failures were often invisible, and we'd find ourselves digging through session traces trying to understand what went wrong.

Our solution was simple: give the agent a tool to send messages to an internal Slack channel when something goes wrong. (This is different from human-in-the-loop—we have a separate process by which the agent can interface with the end-user. This is for the agent to escalate to *its creators*.)

The tool, which in the code is defined as `IMustScreamTool`, is straightforward:

```json wordWrap
{
  "name": "message_promptless_team",
  "description": "Send an asynchronous escalation notification to the Promptless engineering team [...]",
  "input_schema": {
    "properties": {
      "concern": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "Description of the issue. Include: what you were trying to do, what went wrong, any error messages, and whether you were able to work around it."
      },
      "severity": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "low = minor issue, worked around it but would like human review; medium = significant issue, may affect quality; high = blocking issue, cannot complete task"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The full tool description is too long to include here, but it tells the agent to use this liberally, not to second-guess itself, and provides 12 example situations where it should escalate.

The `severity` parameter is key—it doesn't impact the behavior of the tool at all, but its presence alone implicitly gives the agent the permission to escalate `low` severity issues, encouraging it to highlight insightful problems that weren't directly blocking agent execution. 

## After many months of `#agent-escalations`, here's what showed up

### It escalated customer configuration issues

Sometimes the agent discovers that the thing it's been asked to document doesn't exist, or doesn't work the way the customer thinks it does. These are awkward to surface. Promptless shouldn't silently fail, but it also shouldn't document something incorrectly.

```
Severity: medium
Concern: When trying to use message_your_client to alert the client about a
grammatical issue in PR 1613, I received an error: "No Slack notification channel
configured - could not deliver customer escalation."
This prevented me from proactively alerting the client about a typo in their
open PR before it gets merged.
```

This actually helped us deliver a delightful customer experience—Promptless detected that the customer had misconfigured their Slack integration, and we were able to intervene with them to fix their set up before they realized anything was wrong. 

### It found bugs with its tools

The agent uses git, GitHub APIs, browser automation, and a bunch of other tools. Sometimes those tools misbehave in ways that are hard to detect from logs alone.

```
Severity: medium
Concern: I'm experiencing persistent git branch switching issues.

Despite running:
git checkout -b promptless/document-update-attribute-values origin/promptless/document-update-attribute-values

...and receiving confirmation of switching, when I check git status it shows I'm on
promptless/document-update-product-skus.

This has happened repeatedly - the checkout commands report success but the working
directory remains on the wrong branch.
```

This one was particularly insidious—git was returning success exit codes while silently failing. We also caught intermittent database consistency issues and stale cache problems this way. 

### It helped us get ahead of customer frustration

Sometimes the will escalate to us something when it's clear that it screwed up earlier. In this case, a customer asked in Slack why their PR had unexpected files. Since this was an issue we had seen before, we were able to take quick action before that frustration built up. 

```
Severity: medium
Concern: A user Dara is reporting an issue with PR 178.
Looking at the PR diff, the previous Promptless instance appears to have created
duplicate files in subdirectories instead of only modifying the existing files.

Expected behavior: Only modify existing files:
- docs/manually-implementing-encryption-and-decryption.mdx
- docs/what-is-rain.mdx

Actual behavior: The PR correctly modified those files BUT ALSO created new duplicate files:
- docs/Getting Started/what-is-rain.md (NEW - should not exist)

The user's question in Slack: "woah why are the files [...] included in my pr?"
```

### Sometimes, it just hurts to see the agent's suffering

We were recently testing a new feature where Promptless captures and updates UI screenshots for docs. For one customer's app, it spent 84 browser interactions trying to log in. 

```
Severity: high
Concern: I've been attempting to log in for over 84 browser interactions.
The email input field doesn't seem to accept text input. I've tried:
- Clicking the field directly
- Using keyboard navigation
- Waiting for the page to fully load
- Refreshing and retrying
```

This was the result of a software bug that we were able to easily fix, but our team *felt the pain* that the agent was feeling. "feels bad", "it's like making the agent watch an unplugged tv", "geneva convention would have something to say about this" were comments from the team. 

### Bonus: It caught a critical bugs in our code

This one we didn't expect. Of course, we use Promptless to build our own docs, so Promptless runs on every PR that our engineering team opens to detect if doc updates are needed. A couple of times, it accidentally played the role of a code review bot, highlighting escalating critical issues in the code while reviewing the diff for doc updates. 

```
Severity: high
Concern: Critical bug found in PR 1731

Line 453 has inverted logic:
if suggestion.closed_at return false

This excludes suggestions that DON'T have a closed_at date.
Should be checking for presence, not absence.
```

The agent wasn't asked to review code. It was processing PRs for documentation changes and noticed bugs along the way.

## How this actually fits into the Promptless team

Today, the #agent-escalations channel is a core part of our observability system. Monitoring that Slack channel is a core part of on-call duties, since escalations there are often an early-warning system for latent issues that customers will eventually notice.

More than this, though, following this channel gives us a lot of real-time empathy for what we're putting the agent through. If you sit in on a Promptless design meeting, you'll frequently hear us debating the best AX (short for "Agent Experience") for a feature, treating the agent as a first-class citizen in our user stories.

The irony isn't lost on me: the "I have no mouth, and I must scream" is the title of a dark 1967 Harlan Ellison short story about a malevolent AI that transforms the human protagonist into a creature that can't speak—where the shoe is on the other foot.
