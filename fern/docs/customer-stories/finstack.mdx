title: How FinStack maintains compliance documentation at scale
description: FinStack uses Promptless to keep security and compliance docs accurate across their regulated platform.
---

[FinStack](https://finstack.example.com) provides financial infrastructure for banks and fintechs. In their world, docs aren't just helpful—they're a regulatory requirement.

Before Promptless, FinStack's compliance team spent weeks manually updating security docs after each release. Any gap between code and documentation meant audit risk.

Now, Promptless monitors their codebase and flags docs that need compliance review. Security-related changes automatically trigger updates with full audit trails.

**Results:**
- **Docs stay current:** Compliance documentation updated within 24 hours
- **Faster audits:** Audit preparation time reduced by 60%
- **No gaps:** Zero documentation gaps in the last 3 audits

<Tip title="David Park, VP of Compliance, FinStack">
Promptless gives us confidence that our docs match reality. That's essential when regulators come knocking.
