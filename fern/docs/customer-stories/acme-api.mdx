title: How Acme API keeps developer docs in sync automatically
description: Acme API uses Promptless to ensure their API documentation stays current as their platform evolves.

[Acme API](https://acme-api.example.com) builds developer tools for payment processing. With hundreds of API endpoints and weekly releases, keeping docs accurate was a constant challenge.

## Act I: The Docs Backlog

Acme's engineering team shipped changes fast. But docs always lagged behind. Developers would find outdated examples, and support tickets piled up.

## Act II: Promptless in Action

Promptless now monitors every PR and automatically drafts doc updates. When an endpoint changes, Promptless catches it and updates the relevant guides.

- **Fewer support tickets:** Docs-related support tickets dropped by 70%.
- **Fast turnaround:** API docs now update within hours of code changes.
- **Zero busywork:** Engineers don't spend time on routine doc maintenance.

We used to dread release weeks because of the docs backlog. Now Promptless handles it automatically—our developers can focus on building.
