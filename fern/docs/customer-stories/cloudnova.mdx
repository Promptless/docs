title: How CloudNova turns support conversations into documentation
description: CloudNova uses Promptless to transform Slack support threads into polished help articles.

[CloudNova](https://cloudnova.example.com) is a cloud infrastructure platform serving thousands of developers. Their support team kept answering the same questions in Slack.

## The Challenge

CloudNova had active Slack Connect channels with customers. Great questions got great answers—but those answers lived only in Slack threads, buried and unsearchable.

## The Solution

With Promptless, support engineers trigger doc updates from Slack. A quick @Promptless mention turns troubleshooting conversations into help center articles.

**Results:**
- 40% fewer repeat questions
- Support contributes to docs without context switching
- 35% increase in customer self-service

Our best support content used to disappear into Slack history. Now it becomes documentation that helps everyone.
