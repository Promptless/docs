title: Interacting with Promptless PRs
description: Learn how to provide follow-up instructions through GitHub PR comments and reviews after your documentation PR is opened
---

After Promptless opens a docs PR, you can provide follow-on instructions directly through GitHub comments. 

## Two ways of providing feedback

### 1. Individual comments

Leave individual comments on specific lines or sections of the documentation PR for targeted feedback.

    Tag Promptless (@Promptless) in the comment (Note: It won't show up in auto-complete), write your instruction, and click "Add single comment" to submit your instruction to Promptless.

</Frame>
<Note>
  When using single comments, Promptless doesn't yet have the ability to look at other previous comments. So instructions like "Same here" wouldn't work. You can either spell out the instruction completely, or use the PR review comments below, where Promptless will have context on other comments in the same review.
</Note>

### 2. PR reviews

Start a review to provide multiple pieces of feedback that Promptless can handle all at once.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start a Review">
    You can either click "Review changes" to begin a formal review process, or when adding an in-line comment, select the "Start a review" option instead of the "Add single comment" option.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Multiple Comments">
    Continue adding comments as part of the review. You don't have to tag Promptless in any of them.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Include General Feedback">
    After you're done reviewing, click on "Finish your review", and in the text box, tag Promptless (@Promptless). And then Promptless will address all your review feedback at once.
