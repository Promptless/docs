Promptless provides workflow management features that help teams organize, track, and collaborate on documentation suggestions. These tools make it easier to coordinate releases and manage the doc review process among writers, engineers, and subject-matter experts.

## Suggestion Assignment

You can assign specific suggestions to team members for review and approval.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Assign a Suggestion">
    Navigate to the suggestion you want to assign and select a team member from the assignee dropdown. The assigned team member will be notified and can see all suggestions assigned to them.
  </Step>

  <Step title="View Assigned Suggestions">
    Use the assignee filter in the suggestions list to view all suggestions assigned to specific team members, including yourself.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Labeling System

Labels can help organize suggestions based on their project area, priority, or target release. You can add multiple labels to a suggestion.

### Common Label Use Cases

  <Card title="Content Types" icon="regular tags">
    Organize suggestions by content type such as "API Documentation", "User Guides", "Troubleshooting", or "Getting Started".
  </Card>

  <Card title="Priority Levels" icon="regular flag">
    Use priority labels like "High Priority", "Low Priority", or "Urgent" to help team members focus on the most important updates first.

    Track review progress with labels like "Needs Review", "In Progress", "Ready to Publish", or "On Hold".
