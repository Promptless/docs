description: A comprehensive walkthrough for creating documentation PRs from Slack all the way through to merging on GitHub
---

This guide walks you through creating documentation PRs with Promptless—from tagging in Slack to merging on GitHub.

## Workflow Overview

1. **Trigger** - Tag Promptless in Slack with your documentation request
2. **Review** - View the generated suggestion in the web interface
3. **Refine** - Make edits using Slack follow-ups or web interface feedback
4. **Publish** - Create a PR from the approved suggestion
5. **Iterate** - Request additional changes via GitHub PR comments

## Step 1: Tag Promptless in Slack

Trigger a documentation update from Slack using one of these methods:

### Option A: Use a Message Action (Recommended)

Use this to turn existing conversations into documentation.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Message Actions">
    Click the three dots (⋯) menu on any Slack message you want to document.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Update Docs">
    Choose "Update Docs" from the menu. If you don't see it, click "More message shortcuts" and search for Promptless.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for Notification">
    Promptless will analyze the thread and DM you when ready.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Option B: Mention Promptless in a Channel

Use this to provide specific instructions or context.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Tag Promptless">
    Type `@Promptless` followed by your request. Include relevant links, context, or instructions.
    
    Example:
    ```txt wordWrap
    @Promptless please document the new authentication flow we discussed in this thread, including the error handling section
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Promptless to Channel">
    If this is your first time tagging Promptless in the channel, add the bot first.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for Response">
    Promptless will reply in the thread when ready.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Option C: Send a Direct Message

Use this for private requests or very specific instructions.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open DM with Promptless">
    Go to Apps in Slack and click the Promptless bot to open a DM.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send Your Request">
    Type your request (no need to tag in DMs). Include links, images, or other context.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for Notification">
    Promptless will DM you when ready.
  </Step>
</Steps>

</Tip>

## Step 2: View the Suggestion

You'll receive a notification with a link to view your suggestion in the web interface.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click the Suggestion Link">
    Click the link in the Slack notification to open the suggestion in your browser.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review the Changes">
    The suggestion shows:
    - A preview of the documentation changes
    - Which files will be created or modified
    - The specific content that will be added or updated
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check the Content">
    Make sure the documentation is accurate, complete, and matches your requirements. Check:
    - Technical accuracy
    - Completeness of information
    - Appropriate tone and style
    - Correct formatting and structure
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Refine the Suggestion (Optional)

If the suggestion needs adjustments, provide feedback using either method below.

### Option A: Slack Follow-up Instructions

Use this for quick iterations and conversational feedback.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Reply in the Original Thread">
    Go back to the Slack thread where Promptless notified you.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Tag Promptless with Instructions">
    **Important:** You must tag `@Promptless` in your follow-up message.
    
    Example:
    ```txt wordWrap
    @Promptless please also add a troubleshooting section covering the connection timeout error
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for Updated Suggestion">
    Promptless will update the suggestion and notify you when ready.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
You can provide multiple rounds of feedback. Just remember to tag @Promptless in each follow-up message.
</Note>

### Option B: Web Interface Feedback

Use this for detailed, line-specific feedback on multiple sections.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Highlight Text">
    In the suggestion view, select text you want to comment on. An "Add Comment" button will appear.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Provide Feedback">
    Click "Add Comment" and type your feedback. You can add multiple comments to different sections.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Feedback Options">
    Before submitting, you'll see two checkboxes:
    - **Request changes on this suggestion** - Updates this suggestion based on your feedback
    - **Remember feedback for future suggestions** - Applies this feedback to future documentation
  </Step>

  <Step title="Submit Feedback">
    Click submit. If you requested changes, Promptless will update the suggestion and notify you when ready.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Learn more about web interface feedback in our [Using the Web Interface](/docs/how-to-use-promptless/using-the-web-interface) guide.
</Tip>

## Step 4: Create the PR

Once you're satisfied with the suggestion, create a GitHub PR.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Approve the Suggestion">
    In the suggestion view, look for the "Create PR" or "Publish" button.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Create PR">
    Click the button to create a pull request. Promptless will:
    - Create a new branch with your changes
    - Open a pull request with a descriptive title
    - Include the documentation changes
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review the PR on GitHub">
    Click the link to view your PR on GitHub. Do a final review to make sure everything looks correct.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
If your project has auto-publish enabled, PRs may be created automatically. Check your project settings to configure this behavior.
</Info>

## Step 5: Request Changes via GitHub

If you need additional changes after the PR is created, provide feedback directly on GitHub.

### Option A: Single Line Comments

Use this for quick, isolated feedback on specific lines.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Line Comment">
    In the GitHub PR, click the "+" icon next to the line you want to comment on.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Tag Promptless">
    Type `@Promptless` in your comment (it won't autocomplete, but it works). Then provide your instruction.
    
    Example:
    ```txt wordWrap
    @Promptless please add a code example for this API endpoint
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Submit as Single Comment">
    Click "Add single comment" (not "Start a review") to submit immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Each single comment is processed independently. Promptless doesn't have context from other comments, so avoid instructions like "Same here" or "Apply this to the section above too."
</Note>

### Option B: GitHub PR Review

Use this for multiple pieces of feedback that should be addressed together.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start a Review">
    Click "Review changes" at the top of the PR, or when adding an inline comment, select "Start a review" instead of "Add single comment".
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Multiple Comments">
    Add comments throughout the PR as part of your review. You don't need to tag Promptless in individual review comments.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Finish the Review">
    Click "Finish your review", then tag `@Promptless` in the summary text box and provide general instructions or context.
    
    Example:
    ```txt wordWrap
    @Promptless please address all the comments in this review. Also, ensure all code examples use TypeScript.
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Submit Review">
    Select "Comment" (or "Request changes") and click "Submit review". Promptless will process all comments together and update the PR.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>

</Tip>

## Step 6: Merge the PR

Once you're satisfied with the documentation:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Final Review">
    Do a final review of the PR to make sure everything is correct and complete.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get Approvals">
    If your team requires PR approvals, request reviews from team members.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Merge">
    Click "Merge pull request" on GitHub to merge the changes into your main branch.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Publication">
    Verify the changes appear correctly on your published documentation site.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Workflow

Here's how this might look in practice:

**1. Trigger in Slack:**
```txt wordWrap
@Promptless please document our new OAuth 2.0 authentication flow. Include setup steps, code examples, and common troubleshooting issues from this thread.
```

**2. Review suggestion:** Promptless DMs you → Click link → Review docs

**3. Request refinement (Slack):**
```txt wordWrap
@Promptless please add a section about refresh token handling and token expiration
```

**4. Create PR:** Click "Create PR" in web interface

**5. Request changes (GitHub PR Review):**
- Comment 1: "Add rate limiting information to this section"
- Comment 2: "Update this code example to use our latest SDK version"
- Review summary: "@Promptless please address the comments above and ensure all examples use async/await syntax"

**6. Final review and merge:** Approve → Merge → Done!
