<Note>
  Make sure you have the [Slack integration](/docs/integrations/slack-integration) set up before using these features.

## Four Ways to Interact

### 1. Message Actions

Use Slack's message actions to quickly trigger documentation updates from any message or thread. This is best used when you don't want to interrupt the flow of the conversation.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Message Actions">
    Click the three dots (â‹¯) menu on any Slack message to open the message actions menu.

    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Update Docs">
    Choose "Update Docs" from the message actions menu to trigger Promptless. If you don't see the option, click on "More message shortcuts" and search for Promptless.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Generated Content">
    Promptless will analyze the full thread to generate relevant documentation updates, and DM you once it's done.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 2. Channel Mentions

Tag Promptless directly in any channel to trigger documentation updates from ongoing discussions.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Mention Promptless">
    Tag Promptless bot in a new message or in a thread reply in a channel, along with instructions about how to update the docs, you can add internal and external links, slack links, as well as images. Don't forget to add Promptless bot to the channel if you're tagging it for the first time!
  </Step>

  <Step title="Thread Context Analysis">
    Promptless will analyze the entire thread context to understand the discussion and generate relevant documentation. You can point Promptless to specific pages, or Promptless can infer based on the context.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip title="Editing Suggestions in Slack">
  Promptless will reply in the thread once it's done draft updates. From there, you can add follow-on instructions in the same thread to tell Promptless to edit the suggestion. **You must still tag @Promptless in your follow-up messages** to ensure Promptless sees and processes your additional guidance or corrections.
</Tip>

### Example Instructions

```txt wordWrap
@Promptless please also add a troubleshooting section covering the error cases we discussed earlier in this thread
```

```txt wordWrap
@Promptless make sure to mention that this feature is only available in the Enterprise plan
```

```txt wordWrap
@Promptless create a mermaid chart for the system architecture discussed in this thread`
```

### 3. Direct Messages (DMs)

Send direct messages to Promptless for private documentation requests or when you have very specific instructions.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start a DM">
    Go to the Apps section in Slack, click on the Promptless bot.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Describe Your Request">
    Type your documentation request or paste content you'd like to turn into documentation. You can post internal or external links, slack links, images, etc. You don't have to tag Promptless here.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for Promptless DM">
    Promptless will DM you with the doc updates.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 4. Passive Channel Listening

Have Promptless automatically monitor specific Slack channels and create documentation updates without requiring @mentions or message actions. This is ideal for documentation-focused or support channels where discussions frequently reveal documentation needs.

When passive listening is enabled, Promptless monitors all messages in your selected channels and automatically creates documentation suggestions when threads become inactive.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Project Settings">
    Go to the [projects page](https://app.gopromptless.ai/projects) and click the edit button on your Slack trigger project.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable Passive Listening">
    Check the box for "Listen for all messages in specific channels" under the trigger configuration.

    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Channels">
    Choose which channels Promptless should monitor. You can select multiple channels.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Click "Save" to activate passive listening for the selected channels.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Accordion title="Will Promptless create a new suggestion for every new message in the thread?">
  No. When passive listening is enabled, Promptless waits for a thread to go quiet before analyzing it. This prevents creating redundant suggestions as conversations evolve.
  
  If new messages are added to a thread that Promptless has already processed, Promptless can update its existing suggestion rather than creating a duplicate. This means even if there are multiple triggers for the same thread, you'll see updates to a single suggestion rather than a flood of separate suggestions.
  
  **Tip**: If you @mention Promptless in a thread that's being passively monitored, it will trigger immediately rather than waiting for the thread to go quiet.
</Accordion>

<Note>
  Passive listening is completely opt-in. Promptless only monitors channels you explicitly select in your project configuration. You can add or remove channels at any time.
