Deep Analysis handles large, complex documentation requests that require extended processing time and may create multiple suggestions across your docs.

## When to use Deep Analysis

Use Deep Analysis for requests that go beyond individual page updates:

- **Refactoring documentation sections** - Restructure or rewrite entire sections to match a new pattern or better examples
- **Documentation audits** - Review all documentation for consistency, accuracy, or style compliance
- **Writing docs from scratch** - Create comprehensive documentation for new features or products
- **Adding to OpenAPI specs** - Add error codes, examples, or other structured data across your API documentation

For routine updates, use Slack, GitHub PR triggers, or the New Task feature instead.
