### Comment and feedback

Select to highlight specific portions of documentation to provide targeted comment or feedback.

When providing feedback through the web interface, you'll see two checkbox options that control how your feedback is processed:

**1. Request changes on this suggestion**

    When checked, this option tells Promptless to apply your feedback and make changes to the current documentation suggestion. You'll be able to add more comments and submit them for implementaion all in one go.

**2. Remember feedback for future suggestions**

    When checked, this option saves your feedback preferences and applies them to future documentation suggestions. This helps Promptless learn your style preferences and documentation standards over time.
    
    **Examples of feedback to remember:**
    - "Always include code examples for API endpoints"
    - "Use active voice instead of passive voice"
    - "Include troubleshooting sections for configuration guides"

## Suggestion Status Indicators

When viewing individual suggestion details, Promptless displays status chips next to the GitHub PR link to show you the current state of your documentation changes.

### Understanding Status Chips

**Merged (Green)**: Your suggestion's pull request has been successfully merged into the target repository. Your documentation updates are now live.

**Open (Default)**: The pull request for your suggestion is still open and pending review or merge.

These status indicators help you track the progress of your documentation changes and understand when your updates have been successfully deployed to your documentation site.
