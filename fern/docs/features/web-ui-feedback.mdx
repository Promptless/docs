### Comment and feedback

Select to highlight specific portions of documentation to provide targeted comment or feedback.

When providing feedback through the web interface, you'll see two checkbox options that control how your feedback is processed:

**1. Request changes on this suggestion**

    When checked, this option tells Promptless to apply your feedback and make changes to the current documentation suggestion. You'll be able to add more comments and submit them for implementaion all in one go.

**2. Remember feedback for future suggestions**

    When checked, this option saves your feedback preferences and applies them to future documentation suggestions. This helps Promptless learn your style preferences and documentation standards over time.
    
    **Examples of feedback to remember:**
    - "Always include code examples for API endpoints"
    - "Use active voice instead of passive voice"
    - "Include troubleshooting sections for configuration guides"

## Choosing the Right Feedback Method

Understanding when and how to provide feedback helps Promptless improve both your immediate documentation needs and the platform's overall capabilities.

### Suggestion-Level Feedback

Use the web interface feedback options (described above) when you need to:

- **Make specific edits to current suggestions**: Request targeted changes to the documentation draft you're reviewing
- **Set future documentation preferences**: Establish guidelines that Promptless should remember for upcoming documentation updates (e.g., "only update this section when code changes in the authentication module")
- **Provide style or formatting corrections**: Help Promptless learn your organization's documentation standards

<Tip>
This type of feedback is best for tactical improvements that directly enhance the current suggestion or establish patterns for similar future documentation.
</Tip>

### General Platform Feedback

For broader feedback about Promptless capabilities or feature requests, reach out through your team's communication channels or contact support:

- **Feature requests**: Suggestions for new Promptless capabilities or integrations
- **Overall performance feedback**: General observations like "Promptless could better handle technical specifications" or "API documentation needs more context"
- **Workflow improvements**: Ideas for enhancing the documentation generation process

<Note>
This type of feedback is best for strategic improvements that could benefit all Promptless users or require platform-level changes.
</Note>

This dual approach ensures your immediate documentation needs are addressed while contributing to Promptless's continuous improvement.
