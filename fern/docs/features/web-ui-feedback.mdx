### Comment and feedback

Select to highlight specific portions of documentation to provide targeted comment or feedback.

![Add Comment button in web interface](https://promptless-customer-doc-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/docs-images/org_2lvkgU9erOFxYhtEVVC0ymPrPdF/web-ui-add-comment-button-1759356264.png)

When providing feedback through the web interface, you'll see two checkbox options that control how your feedback is processed:

**1. Request changes on this suggestion**

    When checked, this option tells Promptless to apply your feedback and make changes to the current documentation suggestion. You'll be able to add more comments and submit them for implementaion all in one go.

**2. Remember feedback for future suggestions**

    When checked, this option saves your feedback preferences and applies them to future documentation suggestions. This helps Promptless learn your style preferences and documentation standards over time.
    
    **Examples of feedback to remember:**
    - "Always include code examples for API endpoints"
    - "Use active voice instead of passive voice"
    - "Include troubleshooting sections for configuration guides"
