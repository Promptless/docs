### Comment and feedback

Select to highlight specific portions of documentation to provide targeted comment or feedback.

When providing feedback through the web interface, you'll see two checkbox options that control how your feedback is processed:

**1. Request changes on this suggestion**

    When checked, this option tells Promptless to apply your feedback and make changes to the current documentation suggestion. You'll be able to add more comments and submit them for implementaion all in one go.

**2. Remember feedback for future suggestions**

    When checked, this option saves your feedback preferences and applies them to future documentation suggestions. This helps Promptless learn your style preferences and documentation standards over time.
    
    **Examples of feedback to remember:**
    - "Always include code examples for API endpoints"
    - "Use active voice instead of passive voice"
    - "Include troubleshooting sections for configuration guides"

## Timeline View Tracking

The suggestion timeline displays view tracking information, showing when team members have reviewed your documentation suggestions. This provides transparency into collaboration and engagement patterns.

<Info>
View tracking helps teams coordinate on documentation changes and ensures important updates receive appropriate reviewer attention.
