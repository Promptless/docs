### Comment and feedback

Select to highlight specific portions of documentation to provide targeted comment or feedback.

When providing feedback through the web interface, you'll see two checkbox options that control how your feedback is processed:

**1. Request changes on this suggestion**

    When checked, this option tells Promptless to apply your feedback and make changes to the current documentation suggestion. You'll be able to add more comments and submit them for implementaion all in one go.

**2. Remember feedback for future suggestions**

    When checked, this option saves your feedback preferences and applies them to future documentation suggestions. This helps Promptless learn your style preferences and documentation standards over time.
    
    **Examples of feedback to remember:**
    - "Always include code examples for API endpoints"
    - "Use active voice instead of passive voice"
    - "Include troubleshooting sections for configuration guides"

### Examples: Using Feedback Effectively

#### Request changes on this suggestion

Use this mode when you want Promptless to update the current documentation suggestion right away. You can request changes like:

```txt wordWrap
Change 'authetication' to 'authentication' in the first paragraph
```

```txt wordWrap
Move the troubleshooting section to the end of the page, after the examples
```

```txt wordWrap
Add a code example showing how to configure the webhook URL
```

```txt wordWrap
Remove the section about OAuth 1.0 - we only support OAuth 2.0
```

```txt wordWrap
Expand the rate limiting explanation to mention the 100 requests per minute limit
```

#### Remember feedback for future suggestions

Use this mode to teach Promptless your team's standards and preferences. Your feedback will apply to all future documentation:

```txt wordWrap
Always use active voice instead of passive voice
```

```txt wordWrap
Write in second person (you/your) rather than first person (we/our)
```

```txt wordWrap
Include a Prerequisites section at the start of all setup guides
```

```txt wordWrap
Use numbered lists for sequential steps and bullet points for non-ordered items
```

```txt wordWrap
Always include code examples for API endpoints
```

```txt wordWrap
Show both success and error response examples for all API calls
```

```txt wordWrap
Use 'documentation project' instead of 'doc project'
```

```txt wordWrap
Always capitalize 'Promptless' when referring to the product
```

#### When to use both

You can check both boxes to fix the current suggestion and save your feedback for the future.

For example, if the current suggestion uses passive voice throughout, check both boxes and provide feedback like "Rewrite all passive voice to active voice." Promptless will update the current suggestion and remember to use active voice in future docs.

Or if the current suggestion lacks a troubleshooting section, check both boxes and say "Add a Troubleshooting section with common error messages." Promptless will add the section now and include troubleshooting in future configuration guides.

### Triggers page

The Triggers page shows all events that triggered Promptless to review your documentation over the last 30 days. Each entry displays:

- **Trigger source**: The event that fired (like a GitHub PR or Slack message)
- **Status**: Whether Promptless completed processing, is still working, or hit an error
- **Suggestions created**: Whether documentation updates were created from this trigger
- **Timestamp**: When the trigger happened

Use the filters at the top to narrow down by trigger type or suggestion status. Click any trigger to see the full details, including what research Promptless did and why it decided to create (or skip) documentation updates.
