### Comment and feedback

Select to highlight specific portions of documentation to provide targeted comment or feedback.

When providing feedback through the web interface, you'll see two checkbox options that control how your feedback is processed:

**1. Request changes on this suggestion**

    When checked, this option tells Promptless to apply your feedback and make changes to the current documentation suggestion. You'll be able to add more comments and submit them for implementaion all in one go.

**2. Remember feedback for future suggestions**

    When checked, this option saves your feedback preferences and applies them to future documentation suggestions. This helps Promptless learn your style preferences and documentation standards over time.
    
    **Examples of feedback to remember:**
    - "Always include code examples for API endpoints"
    - "Use active voice instead of passive voice"
    - "Include troubleshooting sections for configuration guides"

## Timeline View Tracking

### View tracking and visibility

The suggestion timeline now shows when team members have viewed your documentation suggestions, providing transparency into collaboration and engagement.

**What you'll see:**
- Eye icons in the timeline indicate when someone has viewed the suggestion
- User names are displayed with timestamps showing when they viewed
- View events are grouped intelligently to reduce timeline clutter
- Internal Promptless team views are automatically filtered out for privacy

**Benefits for your team:**
- **Enhanced collaboration awareness**: See who has reviewed your documentation changes
- **Engagement insights**: Track which suggestions are getting team attention  
- **Better coordination**: Know when teammates have seen recent updates
- **Transparency**: Clear visibility into the documentation review process

View tracking helps teams stay coordinated on documentation changes and ensures important updates get the right attention from reviewers and stakeholders.
