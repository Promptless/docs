description: View and edit the files that help Promptless understand your documentation style, product context, and workflow preferences
---

Promptless updates these files automatically as it learns from your feedback, but you can also edit them directly.

## Accessing the Agent Knowledge Base

Go to **Settings** and click the **Agent Knowledge Base** tab. If you have multiple docs repositories connected, select the one you want from the dropdown.

## Knowledge Base Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `client_instructions.md` | Guidelines for how Promptless approaches documentation tasks. Updated when Promptless learns new preferences from your feedback. |
| `default_plan_skeleton.md` | Template structure for documentation plans. Updated when you provide feedback on plan organization. |
| `product_overview.md` | High-level context about your product. Generated during initial setup—you can edit this directly or request Promptless to regenerate it. |
| `client_style_guide.md` | Writing style rules and conventions. If your repo includes a style guide or Vale rules, reference those files here. Promptless updates this file as it learns your style preferences from feedback. |

## Viewing and Editing Files

Click any file in the tree view to open it in the editor.

To edit a file:

1. Make your changes in the editor
2. Click **Save**
3. Your changes are committed directly to the repository

<Warning>
Switching files with unsaved changes will discard those changes.
</Warning>

## How Promptless Uses These Files

Promptless reads these files at the start of every documentation task to understand your documentation approach, product terminology, and writing style.

When you provide feedback on suggestions—through PR comments, the web interface, or Slack—Promptless may update these files to apply what it learned to future tasks.
