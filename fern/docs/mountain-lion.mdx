# 🦁 Mountain Lion Joke

You found the hidden page! Here's a classic joke for you:

---

**A mountain lion walks into a cafe.**

He sits down and orders a coffee. After finishing it, he just sits there silently for a long time.

The barista eventually walks over and asks, "Is everything okay? Can I get you anything else?"

The mountain lion looks up and says:

**"No thanks, I'm just here for the big paws."**
