Triggers are events that initiate automated documentation updates in Promptless. When a trigger event occurs, Promptless analyzes the context and determines if documentation updates are needed.

## How Triggers Work

When a trigger event occurs:

1. **Event Detection**: Promptless receives notification of the event (PR opened, message posted, ticket resolved)
2. **Context Analysis**: The system analyzes the event content, including code changes, conversations, or support interactions
3. **Relevance Assessment**: Promptless determines if the event requires documentation updates
4. **Suggestion Creation**: If relevant, Promptless creates documentation suggestions based on the trigger content and connected context sources

## Configuring Triggers

Triggers are configured at the project level in your [projects page](https://app.gopromptless.ai/projects). For each project, you can:

- Select which trigger types to enable
- Configure trigger-specific settings (e.g., repository filters, channel selections)
- Set up auto-publish behavior for documentation updates
- Define notification preferences for your team

Need a trigger type that isn't currently supported? Contact us at [help@gopromptless.ai](mailto:help@gopromptless.ai) - we regularly add new trigger types based on user feedback.

## Auto-publish Mode

When auto-publish is enabled for your project, Promptless automatically creates pull requests in your documentation repository with suggested changes. For [commit triggers](/docs/configuring-promptless/triggers/git-hub-commits), you can optionally enable auto-merge to automatically merge documentation PRs as soon as they're created.

Auto-publish is available for GitHub-based documentation platforms. For CMS platforms like Zendesk or Intercom, documentation updates are created as drafts for review.

## Trigger Events in Documentation PRs

When Promptless creates a pull request for documentation updates, it automatically includes a list of the trigger events that led to those changes in the PR description. This provides valuable context for reviewers and creates clear traceability between documentation updates and their originating events.
