Confluence integration provides access to your documentation spaces for documentation automation. When Confluence is configured as a context source, Promptless can search your Confluence spaces for relevant documentation when creating suggestions.

## How It Works as Context Source

When Confluence is enabled as a context source:

- **Automatic Space Searching**: Promptless searches your Confluence spaces for relevant documentation when creating suggestions
- **Documentation Patterns**: Confluence pages provide context about existing documentation styles, terminology standards, and content structures
- **Architectural Context**: Technical specifications, design decisions, and system architecture documented in Confluence inform new documentation
- **Team Knowledge**: Internal processes, guidelines, and best practices from your team's Confluence spaces

## Example

When writing API documentation, Promptless searches your Confluence spaces for existing API design patterns, naming conventions, and architectural decisions. This ensures new documentation matches your existing terminology and structure. For instance, if your team documents all API endpoints using a specific format in Confluence, Promptless will follow that same pattern when creating new API documentation.

## Configuration

Configure Confluence context in your [project settings](https://app.gopromptless.ai/projects):

1. Enable Confluence as a context source for your project
2. Select which Confluence spaces Promptless can search within
3. Promptless will only search spaces you explicitly configure

<Note>
Promptless inherits the permissions of the Atlassian account used during OAuth connection and will only search spaces you configure in your project settings.
</Note>

## Data Privacy

Promptless queries Confluence data in real-time and does not store any of your Confluence data. All searches are performed on-demand when documentation updates are needed.

## Setup Instructions

To connect Confluence to Promptless, see the [Atlassian Integration](/docs/integrations/jira-integration) setup guide.
