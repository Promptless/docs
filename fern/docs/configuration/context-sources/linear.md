Linear integration provides secure access to your project management data for documentation automation. When Linear is configured as a context source, Promptless can search for related issues to understand the business context behind code changes.

## How It Works as Context Source

When Linear is enabled as a context source:

- **Automatic Issue Lookup**: When a GitHub PR mentions a Linear issue, Promptless automatically retrieves that issue for additional context
- **Proactive Searches**: Promptless can search Linear for related issues and projects to understand feature requirements
- **Business Context**: Linear issues provide the "why" behind code changes, not just the "what"

## Example

When a GitHub PR mentions a new feature, Promptless searches Linear for related issues to understand additional project context. This ensures your documentation includes business requirements and feature goals alongside technical implementation details.

## Configuration

Configure Linear context in your [project settings](https://app.gopromptless.ai/projects):

1. Enable Linear as a context source for your project
2. Select which Linear teams Promptless can search within
3. Promptless will only search within teams you explicitly select

<Note>
Promptless inherits the permissions of the Linear account used during OAuth connection and will only search teams you configure in your project settings.
</Note>

## Data Privacy

Promptless queries Linear data in real-time and does not store any of your Linear data. All searches are performed on-demand when documentation updates are needed.

## Setup Instructions

To connect Linear to Promptless, see the [Linear Integration](/docs/integrations/linear-integration) setup guide.
