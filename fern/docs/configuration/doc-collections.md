title: Doc Collections
---

Doc Collections are the Git repositories where your documentation lives. Promptless supports docs-as-code workflows where your documentation content is stored in Git and synced to hosting providers.

## Supported Platforms

Promptless works with any Git-hosted documentation platform:

- Fern
- Mintlify
- ReadMe
- GitBook
- Docusaurus
- MkDocs
- Hugo
- Ghost
- Nextra
- Vocs
- Custom platforms as long as the content is in a repo

## Multi-Platform Publishing

Promptless can publish to multiple documentation repositories simultaneously, allowing you to use the same trigger events and context sources across different doc sites.

<Tip>
For teams using multiple doc sites, create separate projects for each documentation location to maintain clear separation of content and workflows.
