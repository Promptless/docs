Intercom integration enables publishing documentation updates directly to your Intercom Help Center. This is useful for teams who manage customer support content through Intercom.

## How It Works

When Intercom is configured as a documentation platform:

1. **Review Suggestions**: Review documentation changes in the Promptless dashboard
2. **Create Drafts**: Click "Save All & Update Intercom" to create drafts in your Help Center
3. **Review in Intercom**: Drafts appear in your Intercom dashboard for final review
4. **Publish**: Publish approved drafts from within Intercom

<Note>
Promptless creates drafts in Intercom. You'll need to publish them from your Intercom dashboard before they're visible to users.
</Note>

## Publishing Options

- **Create New Articles**: Add new help center articles
- **Update Existing Articles**: Modify existing content with new information
- **Manage Article Metadata**: Update titles, descriptions, and categories
- **Add Images**: Include visual content in your help center articles

## Use Cases

Intercom as a documentation platform is especially useful for:

- **Customer Support Documentation**: Maintain help center content based on customer questions
- **In-App Help Articles**: Keep in-product help content current
- **Support Deflection**: Reduce support volume with better documentation
- **Onboarding Content**: Manage customer onboarding guides
