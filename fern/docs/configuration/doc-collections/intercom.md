title: Intercom (Beta)
---

Intercom integration enables publishing documentation updates directly to your Intercom Help Center. This beta feature allows you to manage customer support documentation through the Promptless platform.

## How It Works

When Intercom is configured as a documentation platform:

1. **Review Suggestions**: Review documentation changes in the Promptless dashboard
2. **Create Drafts**: Click "Save All & Update Intercom" to create drafts in your Intercom Help Center
3. **Review in Intercom**: Drafts appear in your Intercom dashboard for final review
4. **Publish**: Manually publish approved drafts from within Intercom

<Note>
The "Save All & Update Intercom" button creates or updates drafts in Intercom. You'll need to review and publish these drafts from within your Intercom dashboard before they become visible to your users.
</Note>

## Publishing Options

When publishing to Intercom, you can:

- **Create New Articles**: Add new help center articles
- **Update Existing Articles**: Modify existing content with new information
- **Manage Article Metadata**: Update titles, descriptions, and categories
- **Add Images**: Include visual content in your help center articles

## Beta Limitations

As this is a beta feature:

- Some advanced Intercom formatting options might not be fully supported
- Changes are always created as drafts for review
- Custom HTML and complex layouts should be verified in Intercom before publishing

## Use Cases

Intercom as a documentation platform is especially useful for:

- **Customer Support Documentation**: Maintain help center content for your customers
- **In-App Help Articles**: Keep in-product help content up-to-date
- **Support Deflection**: Reduce support volume with better documentation
- **Onboarding Content**: Manage customer onboarding documentation
