Document360 integration enables publishing documentation updates directly to your Document360 knowledge base. This is useful for teams who manage customer-facing documentation through Document360's hosted platform.

## How It Works

When Document360 is configured as a documentation platform:

1. **Review Suggestions**: Review documentation changes in the Promptless dashboard
2. **Publish to Document360**: Click "Save All & Update Document360" to publish approved changes
3. **Knowledge Base Updates**: Content is created or updated in your Document360 knowledge base
4. **Live URLs**: Each published article includes a live URL and editor URL for easy access
5. **Customer Access**: Updated articles are immediately available to your customers

## Publishing Options

When publishing to Document360, you can:

- **Create New Articles**: Add new knowledge base articles and help content
- **Update Existing Articles**: Modify existing content with new information
- **Per-file Publishing**: Publish individual files independently for granular control
- **Webhook Sync**: Automatic synchronization with your Document360 projects via webhooks
- **Manage Article Metadata**: Update titles, descriptions, categories, and project organization
- **Add Images**: Include screenshots and diagrams in your knowledge base content

## Use Cases

Document360 as a documentation platform is especially useful for:

- **Customer Knowledge Base**: Maintain help center articles based on product updates and customer feedback
- **Technical Documentation**: Keep API documentation and technical guides up-to-date
- **Internal Documentation**: Manage team wikis and internal process documentation
- **Multi-project Documentation**: Handle documentation for multiple products or services from a single workflow
- **Support Deflection**: Update documentation to reduce recurring support requests
