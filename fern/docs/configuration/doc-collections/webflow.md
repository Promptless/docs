title: Webflow (Beta)
---

Webflow integration enables publishing content updates directly to your Webflow CMS. This beta feature allows you to manage blog posts, collection items, and other CMS content through the Promptless platform.

## How It Works

When Webflow is configured as a documentation platform:

1. **Review Suggestions**: Review content changes in the Promptless dashboard
2. **Publish to Webflow**: Click "Save All & Update Webflow" to publish approved changes
3. **CMS Updates**: Content is created or updated in your Webflow CMS
4. **Site Publishing**: Content is automatically published to your live site (if auto-publish is enabled)

## Content Types Supported

Webflow integration supports various content types:

- **Blog Posts**: Articles, announcements, updates
- **Collection Items**: Custom content types defined in your Webflow CMS
- **Static Pages**: About pages, landing pages, documentation pages
- **Rich Content**: Text formatting, images, links, and embedded media

## Publishing Options

You can configure how Promptless publishes to Webflow:

- **Draft Mode**: Create content as drafts for manual review and publishing
- **Auto-publish**: Automatically publish approved content to your live site
- **Staging**: Publish to a staging environment first for testing

## Managing Blog Posts

Promptless can help you manage your Webflow blog posts by:

- **Creating New Posts**: Add new articles, announcements, or content pages
- **Updating Existing Posts**: Modify content, add new sections, or update information
- **Managing Metadata**: Update titles, descriptions, tags, and other CMS fields
- **Adding Images**: Include screenshots, diagrams, and other visual content

## Beta Limitations

As this is a beta feature:

- Some advanced Webflow CMS field types might not be fully supported
- Custom code and complex layouts should be verified in Webflow after publishing
- Rich text formatting may require manual adjustment for optimal display
- Collection structure changes should be made directly in Webflow

## Use Cases

Webflow as a documentation platform is especially useful for:

- **Marketing Content**: Blog posts and marketing site content
- **Product Documentation**: Technical documentation alongside marketing content
- **Changelog Publishing**: Keep product changelogs up-to-date
- **Content Marketing**: Manage blog and content marketing at scale
