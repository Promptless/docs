Promptless can monitor direct commits to your default branches for documentation updates. This is useful for teams that merge changes directly without pull requests, or when you want to capture documentation needs from hotfixes and emergency changes.

## How It Works

When a commit is pushed directly to a monitored branch:

1. **Commit Detection**: Promptless receives notification of the new commit
2. **Analysis**: The system processes the code diff and commit message to understand the changes
3. **Relevance Assessment**: Promptless determines if the changes require documentation updates
4. **Suggestion Creation**: If relevant, Promptless creates documentation suggestions

## Commit Triggers vs. Pull Request Triggers

You can use GitHub commit triggers alongside PR triggers, or as a standalone approach.

### Use commits alongside PR triggers

If you configure both a GitHub PR project and a GitHub Commits project for the same repositories:

- Promptless comments on PRs while they're open, providing early feedback on documentation needs
- After the PR merges, the commit trigger updates suggestions with the final merged content
- Useful when you want PR comments during review and updated suggestions after merge

### Use commits only

If you configure only a GitHub Commits project, without a corresponding PR project:

- Promptless only runs after changes merge to your default branch
- Reduces notification noise if PR triggers are too frequent
- Since you won't get PR comments, configure a Slack notification channel to stay informed about new suggestions

## Configuration

Configure GitHub commit triggers in your [project settings](https://app.gopromptless.ai/projects):

1. Select GitHub as your trigger source
2. Choose "GitHub Commits" as the trigger type
3. Select which repositories and branches to monitor
4. Optionally configure directory-specific triggers
5. Set auto-publish preferences

## Notification Channels

Since commit triggers don't create PR comments, configure a Slack notification channel to receive updates when Promptless creates or updates suggestions.

To configure a notification channel:

1. Go to your [project settings](https://app.gopromptless.ai/projects)
2. Click the pencil icon to edit your GitHub Commits project
3. Select your preferred Slack channel from the dropdown
4. Save your changes

<Note>
If your channel doesn't appear in the dropdown, create it in Slack first, then refresh your Slack channels on the Integrations page.
</Note>

<Note>
For private Slack channels, invite Promptless first by tagging `@Promptless` in the channel.
</Note>

## Directory-Specific Commits

Similar to PR triggers, you can configure Promptless to only trigger on commits that affect specific directories. This is particularly useful for monitoring changelog directories or specific feature areas.

When trigger directories are specified, only commits that contain changes to those directories will trigger documentation updates.

## Use Cases

GitHub commit triggers are especially useful for:

- **Changelog Monitoring**: Automatically update documentation when changelog files are modified
- **Hotfix Documentation**: Capture documentation needs from emergency fixes that bypass the normal PR process
- **Direct-to-Main Workflows**: Support teams that commit directly to main branches
- **Automated Updates**: Trigger documentation updates from automated commit processes
