title: Microsoft Teams Messages

Microsoft Teams integration enables automated documentation updates based on team communication and collaboration within your Teams environment. Similar to Slack, you can trigger documentation updates directly from your conversations.

## Trigger Methods

### Tag @Promptless in a Channel

Mention @Promptless in a Teams channel with specific instructions or questions. Promptless will analyze the conversation context to create relevant documentation updates.

### Send a Direct Message

Send documentation requests directly to @Promptless in a DM for private documentation requests.

## How It Works

When triggered in Microsoft Teams:

1. **Message Analysis**: Promptless reads the message and conversation context where it was triggered
2. **Context Gathering**: The system analyzes text content and conversation flow
3. **Documentation Suggestions**: Promptless creates suggestions based on the conversation content
4. **Review**: Review and approve suggestions in the Promptless web interface

## Configuration

Configure Microsoft Teams triggers in your [project settings](https://app.gopromptless.ai/projects):

1. Select Microsoft Teams as your trigger source
2. Set auto-publish preferences
3. Configure notification preferences

## Privacy and Access

Promptless only reads Microsoft Teams content when you explicitly trigger it by tagging @Promptless in a conversation. The system does not monitor channels passively.

## Setup Instructions

To connect Microsoft Teams to Promptless, see the [Microsoft Teams Integration](/docs/integrations/microsoft-teams-integration) setup guide.

<Info>
Microsoft Teams integration requires admin center access to install the Promptless Teams app. See the setup guide for detailed installation instructions.
