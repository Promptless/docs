# Documentation Platforms

Documentation platforms are where your docs live. Promptless connects to Fern, Mintlify, ReadMe, and Zendesk. Enable integrations so Promptless can update your docs.

## GitHub-Synced Documentation Platforms

The most common setup uses the **Promptless GitHub App** to integrate with documentation platforms that sync content from GitHub repositories. A list of platforms supported by the GitHub integration:
- Fern
- Mintlify
- ReadMe (Refactored)
- GitBook
- Docusaurus
- MkDocs
- Hugo
- Ghost
- Nextra
- Vocs
- Custom CMS as long as the content is in a repo

For more detailed step-by-step instructions, go to the [GitHub integrations page](/docs/integrations/github-integration).

## Direct CMS Platform Integrations

For teams using content management systems that don't sync with GitHub, Promptless offers direct integrations with popular CMS platforms.

## Multi-Platform Publishing

Promptless can publish to multiple documentation locations simultaneously, allowing you to use the same trigger events and context sources across different platforms.

<Tip title="Best Practice">
For teams using multiple platforms, create separate projects for each documentation location to maintain clear separation of content and workflows.
