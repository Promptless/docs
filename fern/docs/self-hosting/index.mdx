# Self-Hosting Overview

Self-hosting Promptless allows you to deploy the platform on your own infrastructure, giving you complete control over your data, security, and compliance requirements. This is ideal for organizations with strict data governance policies, regulatory compliance needs, or those who prefer to maintain full control over their documentation automation infrastructure.

## Why Self-Host Promptless?

Self-hosting Promptless provides several key benefits for enterprise organizations:

### Data Sovereignty & Security
- **Complete Data Control**: Your documentation, code analysis, and generated content never leaves your infrastructure
- **Enhanced Security**: Deploy within your existing security perimeter with your own authentication systems
- **Compliance Ready**: Meet strict regulatory requirements like HIPAA, SOC 2, GDPR, or FedRAMP
- **Air-Gapped Deployments**: Support for completely isolated environments without external access

### Customization & Integration
- **Custom Authentication**: Integrate with your existing SAML, OIDC, or Active Directory systems
- **Network Integration**: Deploy within your VPC with custom networking and security groups
- **Resource Control**: Scale compute and storage resources based on your specific needs
- **Custom LLM Models**: Use your own fine-tuned models or private LLM deployments

### Operational Control
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Choose your preferred cloud provider or on-premises infrastructure
- **Maintenance Windows**: Control when updates and maintenance occur
- **Monitoring Integration**: Use your existing observability and alerting systems
- **Backup Strategies**: Implement your organization's backup and disaster recovery policies

## Current Self-Hosting Options

### Kubernetes + Helm (Recommended)

Our primary self-hosting solution uses Kubernetes and Helm charts, providing:

- **Production-Ready**: Battle-tested deployment patterns with comprehensive configuration options
- **Scalable Architecture**: Microservices design that scales with your organization's needs  
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Everything parameterized through `values.yaml` with no chart modifications needed
- **Enterprise Features**: Built-in support for high availability, monitoring, and security best practices

**Supported Platforms:**
- AWS EKS (primary support with detailed guides)
- Google GKE (community supported)
- Azure AKS (community supported)
- On-premises Kubernetes (community supported)

### Alternative Deployment Options

While Kubernetes + Helm is our recommended and fully supported option, we understand that different organizations have different infrastructure preferences and requirements.

**Need Something Different?**

If Kubernetes doesn't fit your infrastructure requirements, we can work with you to explore alternative deployment options:

- **Docker Compose**: For simpler deployments or development environments
- **VM-based Deployments**: Traditional server deployments with systemd services
- **Container Platforms**: OpenShift, Rancher, or other container orchestration platforms
- **Cloud-Native Services**: Serverless or managed service deployments
- **Hybrid Deployments**: Combining cloud and on-premises components

<Note>
Alternative deployment options require custom engineering work and are available as part of our Enterprise support packages. [Contact our team](mailto:hello@gopromptless.ai) to discuss your specific requirements and timeline.
