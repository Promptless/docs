## Guided Setup Wizard

When you first sign in, a 6-step wizard guides you through setup:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect Slack">
    Set up Slack for notifications and to trigger documentation updates via @mentions
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect docs">
    Connect your documentation repository (GitHub or other Git providers)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure triggers">
    Choose which events trigger documentation updates (GitHub PRs, Slack messages, etc.)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Additional context">
    Optionally connect Linear, Jira, or Confluence for better suggestions
  </Step>

  <Step title="Agent preferences">
    Configure how Promptless behaves when creating suggestions
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start trial">
    Begin your 30-day trial
  </Step>
</Steps>

Your progress saves automatically—if you leave and come back later, you'll pick up where you left off. Team members from the same organization can continue setup without losing previous progress.

## What Gets Configured

During setup, you'll connect:

**Triggers** - Events that prompt Promptless to generate documentation suggestions
- **GitHub/Bitbucket**: Auto-trigger from pull requests
- **Slack**: Manual triggers via @mentions or message actions
  
**Documentation Platform** - Where your docs live
- **GitHub repos**: Supports docs-as-code platforms like ReadMe, Mintlify, Fern, Docusaurus, and more 

**Enhanced Context (optional)** - Connect **Linear**, **Jira**, **Confluence**, or **Slack** to provide Promptless with additional context for better suggestions.

## What's Next?

After creating a project, Promptless will start ingesting and indexing your documentation. This process helps Promptless learn your documentation structure and content, and remember it for future suggestions. This can take 5-30 minutes, depending on the size of your docs.

Once setup is complete, Promptless will:
- Listen for trigger events from your configured sources
- Analyze changes and gather relevant context
- Generate documentation suggestions for your review

<Success>
You're all set! Promptless is now ready to help automate your documentation updates.
