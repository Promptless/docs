# Welcome to Promptless

Promptless automatically updates your documentation, saving your team time and improving your customers' experience.

## Getting Started

Create your account at [accounts.gopromptless.ai](https://accounts.gopromptless.ai). For large documentation sites (200+ articles) or custom integrations, contact [hello@gopromptless.ai](mailto:hello@gopromptless.ai).



## Step 1: Set up integrations

Once you're signed into the [Promptless dashboard](https://app.gopromptless.ai/), visit the [Integrations page](https://app.gopromptless.ai/integrations). From there, you should set up the following integrations:

**Triggers**
Triggers are events that activate Promptless agent to start trying to determine if there needs to be a pull request and draft it. Examples:
- GitHub/Bitbucket/Gitlab pull requests
- Slack mentions and message actions

**Context Sources** (optional)
Context sources are additional context that you can give the Promptless agent to help it have the right knowledge when drafting doc updates. Examples:
- Linear or Jira for project management data
- Slack for conversation history

**Documentation**
Where your docs live.
- GitHub/Bitbucket repositories
- ReadMe (via API key if not synced to GitHub)

**Notifications** (recommended)
We highly recommend setting up Slack or Microsoft Teams integrations so you can get informed whenever Promptless makes a new suggestion. Setting up notifications ensures your team stays informed about documentation updates and can quickly review and approve changes. You can configure Slack or Microsoft Teams to receive alerts when:
- New documentation suggestions are created
- Pull requests are automatically generated
- Manual review is required for draft updates

We recommend creating a dedicated channel (like #docs-updates) where Promptless can send all documentation-related notifications.

Need a different integration? Contact [help@gopromptless.ai](mailto:help@gopromptless.ai) - we add new ones weekly.

## Step 2: Create a project

Visit the [Projects page](https://app.gopromptless.ai/projects) to create your first project. This tells Promptless:
- Which source repositories to monitor
- What context to use (Linear teams, Jira projects, etc.)
- How to handle updates (auto-publish or draft mode)

**Advanced Options:**
- **Auto-publish**: Automatically creates PRs with documentation changes
- **Excluded directories**: Prevent updates to specific folders (internal docs, deprecated content)

After creating a project, Promptless will begin analyzing and indexing your documentation. This initialization process typically takes a few minutes to complete, during which Promptless processes your documentation structure and content.
