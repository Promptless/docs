# Your Promptless Pilot

Promptless offers a generous 30-day pilot period. You'll need to see how Promptless works with your own docs, trigger events, and workflows to experience the magic.

## The 30-Day Pilot Period

Your pilot starts when you create your first suggestion - not from the day you sign up or connect integrations.

<Info>
Setup time doesn't count against your pilot. Days spent on internal approvals for GitHub, Slack, or other integrations won't eat into your 30-day evaluation.
</Info>

You'll have a full month to test Promptless with multiple types of updates, PRs, and documentation changes.

## Before Your Pilot Begins

Set up a few things before you start:

### Connect Integrations

Connect Promptless to your key systems:

- **Source control** - GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, or Bitbucket
- **Communication platforms** - Slack or Microsoft Teams
- **Project management** (optional) - Jira, Linear, ClickUp, or other tools

See our [Integrations documentation](/docs/integrations) for step-by-step setup guides.

### Set Up a Slack Connect Channel

We'll establish a Slack Connect channel between your team and Promptless for questions, feedback, and support throughout your pilot.

### Share Your Documentation Context

Think of this step like onboarding a new technical writer. Share:

- Your style guide (if you have one)
- Vale configuration files (if you use Vale for linting)
- Any other documentation standards or conventions your team follows
- Examples of documentation you're particularly proud of

The more context you share, the better Promptless can match your existing documentation standards. See our guide on [Maximizing Value with Promptless](/docs/onboard-promptless) for more details.

## In-Person Onboarding Workshop

We kick off every pilot with an in-person onboarding session. Most teams do a 90-minute workshop with relevant stakeholders. Larger teams may need multiple 90-minute sessions spread across several days.

Even if your team is fully remote, we'll do an in-person workshop with whoever will be using Promptless most heavily. We'll travel to meet with key team members - in-person kickoffs lead to significantly better pilot outcomes.

### Pre-Workshop Preparation

Before your onboarding session, we'll run Promptless on a set of historical events - typically the last 30 days of PRs from your engineering repositories. When we meet, you'll already have live Promptless suggestions to review together.

### Workshop Goals

During the onboarding workshop, we'll accomplish three key objectives:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Review how Promptless works** - We'll walk through the product, your specific configuration, and how Promptless integrates with your workflows
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Publish your first doc updates** - This is the big one. We'll review suggestions together and get your first Promptless-generated documentation changes merged
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Define success criteria** - We'll establish clear metrics for evaluating your pilot
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Success Criteria for Your Pilot

We recommend two key metrics for evaluating your pilot:

**Suggestion Volume**

How many suggestions Promptless creates matters, but more isn't always better. A one-line correction can't be treated the same as a new article for a recently launched feature. 

Rough guidelines:
- **0-1 person working full-time on docs**: 20-40 suggestions per month
- **2-5 technical writers**: 30-60 suggestions per month
- **Larger teams**: We'll calibrate based on your specific needs

**Suggestion Quality**

Rate Promptless's suggestion quality on a scale from 0 to 10. Our goal: **Promptless should be at least an 8/10**.

This gives us a shared language for discussing quality throughout your pilot. Learn more about [giving feedback to Promptless](/docs/features/giving-feedback) to help improve suggestion quality.

## Documentation Improvement Projects (When Needed)

Sometimes teams aren't ready to pilot Promptless because their docs need foundational work first. Common scenarios:

- Major features are missing from documentation
- Docs need significant refactoring or reorganization
- Documentation doesn't exist yet and needs to be written from scratch

Subject to availability, the Promptless team may be able to help with these needs before or during your pilot. Reach out to discuss your specific situation.

## Weekly Check-Ins During Your Pilot

After your in-person onboarding, we'll schedule brief weekly check-ins (15-30 minutes) to keep your pilot on track.

During these check-ins, we'll review:

1. **Suggestion volume** - How many suggestions did Promptless create in the last week?
2. **Suggestion quality** - How would you rate Promptless's suggestions from the last week (0-10)?
3. **Quality gap analysis** - What's the gap between Promptless's current suggestions and 10/10 suggestions?
4. **Workflow fit** - Is Promptless producing suggestions at the right time? How is it fitting into your team's workflows?

These check-ins help us identify issues quickly and make adjustments to improve your pilot experience.

## Support Throughout Your Pilot

You'll have multiple ways to get help during your pilot:

- **Slack Connect channel** - Direct access to the Promptless team for quick questions
- **Weekly check-ins** - Dedicated time to discuss progress and challenges
- **In-product feedback** - Use the [web interface](/docs/features/web-ui-feedback) or [GitHub PR comments](/docs/features/github-pr-comments) to give feedback directly on suggestions
- **Email support** - Reach out to [help@gopromptless.ai](mailto:help@gopromptless.ai) anytime

## After Your Pilot

At the end of your 30-day pilot, we'll schedule a final review to discuss:

- Whether Promptless met your success criteria
- What worked well and what could be improved
- Next steps for continuing with Promptless

Our goal is for you to have complete clarity on whether Promptless is the right fit for your team.
