Manage your team members and organization settings in Promptless.

## Team Member Management

### How do I add team members to my account?

To add other users to your team account:
1. Click on your organization name in the upper left corner of the dashboard
2. Select "Manage" from the dropdown menu
3. In the management modal, you'll find options to invite new team members

### How do I let team members automatically join my organization?

You can add domains to your organization to streamline the process of adding new members with email addresses from your company domain. When a verified domain is added, users with email addresses from that domain can join your organization based on your selected enrollment mode.

To add domains to your organization:

1. Click on your organization name in the upper left corner of the dashboard
2. Select "Manage" from the dropdown menu
