## How Promptless Works

Promptless operates through three interconnected components that work together to understand your codebase, gather context, and publish updates automatically.

## Who Uses Promptless

Promptless automatically detects when code changes require documentation updates and notifies your team through your existing workflows.

### Development Teams

When you open a PR, Promptless automatically checks if docs need updating and notifies your team in Slack.

</Frame>

Promptless drafts the initial update based on your PR changes, so you can review and publish without switching between tools.

### Technical Writers  

Promptless automatically detects doc-impacting PRs and sends notifications to your Slack channels, so you stay informed without monitoring a hundred release channels or attending every standup.
