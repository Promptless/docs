# Single Sign-On (SSO) Setup

Single Sign-On (SSO) integration enables enterprise organizations to authenticate users through their existing identity provider, streamlining access management and enhancing security across your documentation workflow.

<Info>
SSO integration is available exclusively for enterprise customers. Contact our team at [help@gopromptless.ai](mailto:help@gopromptless.ai) to learn more about enterprise plans and pricing.

## Supported Authentication Methods

Promptless supports enterprise authentication through industry-standard protocols:

- **SAML 2.0**: Compatible with enterprise identity providers including Active Directory Federation Services, Okta, OneLogin, and Azure AD
- **OpenID Connect (OIDC)**: Modern authentication protocol supporting Google Workspace, Azure AD, and other OIDC-compliant providers
- **Direct integrations**: Native support for Google Workspace and GitHub Enterprise authentication

## Prerequisites

Before requesting SSO setup, ensure your organization has:

- An active Promptless enterprise subscription
- Administrative access to your identity provider
- The ability to configure SAML assertions or OIDC claims for user attributes
- A verified domain configured in your Promptless organization settings

## Requesting SSO Configuration

SSO setup requires coordination between your IT team and Promptless. The process involves providing specific configuration details to our team.
