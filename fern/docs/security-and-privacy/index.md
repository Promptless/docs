## Compliance and Certifications

We maintain industry-standard security certifications and compliance frameworks:

- **SOC 2 Type II Certified**: We get regular independent audits for SOC 2 Type II compliance covering security, availability, and confidentiality.
- **GDPR Compliant**: Our data handling practices meet GDPR requirements for data protection and privacy.
- **HIPAA Ready**: Self-hosted deployments can be configured to meet HIPAA compliance requirements.
- **Enterprise Compliance Support**: Self-hosted deployments support additional compliance frameworks including FedRAMP and industry-specific regulations.

For questions about compliance or to request our latest SOC 2 report, contact us at help@gopromptless.ai.

## Operational Security

We use a range of operational security practices to protect customer data:

### Vulnerability Management
We identify, assess, and fix security vulnerabilities as they arise. We prioritize based on risk level and potential impact, addressing critical issues first.

### Change Management
All changes to production systems go through a documented change management process. We test, review, and approve changes before deployment.

### Monitoring and Incident Detection
Our security team monitors production systems for anomalies and security events. Automated alerts help us detect and respond to potential incidents quickly. We keep activity logs for one year for auditing and forensic analysis.

### Development Security
We follow secure development practices including:
- Secure coding training for engineering teams
- Separate development and production environments
- Source code access controls and restrictions
- Security-focused code review processes

## Incident Response

If you suspect a security incident or have security concerns, contact our security team immediately at founders@gopromptless.ai.

We have an incident response plan that covers detection and response procedures, communication with affected customers, root cause analysis, and remediation. Our security team is available to respond to incidents and work with you to address any security concerns.

## Vendor Security

We evaluate all third-party vendors and subprocessors before using them. This includes security assessments, reviewing compliance certifications (SOC 2, ISO 27001, etc.), regular security practice reviews, and contractual commitments to security controls.

For a complete list of subprocessors we work with, see our [Subprocessors page](./subprocessors.md).
