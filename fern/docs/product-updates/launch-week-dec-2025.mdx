description: Five major features we launched this December, from custom voice matching to automated screenshot updates.

This December, we launched five major features. Each day brought a new capability designed to make documentation maintenance faster and more collaborative.

## Day 1: Promptless Voice Match

**Custom fine-tuned models that match your documentation style**

Promptless Voice Match eliminates generic-sounding AI documentation. Promptless ingests your existing docs, style guides, and Vale rules, then fine-tunes a custom model based on your documentation style. The result is AI-generated content that sounds human-written—matching the exact tone and structure you've already established.

In benchmarks using real documentation updates that were either published or rejected, Promptless Voice Match eliminates 92% of AI-generated content that sounds unnatural. If you have sections of your docs that you particularly like and want the rest to match, Promptless can do that too.

## Day 2: Slack Listen

**Automatic documentation suggestions from Slack conversations**

Promptless now listens passively in any Slack channel you choose and automatically detects when a conversation should become a documentation update. No tagging, no manual triggers. When threads become inactive, Promptless creates a draft suggestion if the conversation contained documentation-worthy content.

This works especially well for Slack Connect channels with customers or dedicated documentation discussion channels. You never have to remember "We should really document this somewhere…" and then forget about it.


## Day 3: Promptless Citations

**Every documentation update now shows its sources**

When reviewing Promptless suggestions, you can now see exactly where each change came from. Every documentation update includes citations to the exact GitHub files, diffs, and commits used as sources, along with the Slack threads, customer conversations, and meeting transcripts that were referenced. Promptless also provides a transparent rationale explaining why each line was updated.

This solves a fundamental challenge with AI-generated documentation: verification takes longer than generation. Finding one hallucination makes you wonder how many others are lurking. Instead of pretending hallucinations don't exist, we used tried-and-true methods from research to provide full traceability.

## Day 4: Promptless for Open Source

**Free Promptless licenses for CNCF, Linux Foundation, and Apache projects**

After attending KubeCon and talking with dozens of open-source maintainers, we learned that large OSS projects face unique documentation challenges. Contributors ship PRs but often lack bandwidth for accompanying documentation. Thousands of community conversations on Discord or Slack could be avoided with better docs or turned into great documentation. GitHub Issues requesting documentation improvements sit open for months.

After onboarding Vitess and seeing how helpful Promptless can be for open-source projects, we decided to offer free licenses to CNCF, Linux Foundation, and Apache Software Foundation projects. Open-source projects associated with companies get discounted pricing based on documentation size.

Promptless automatically creates documentation updates from contributor PRs, converts community Discord or Slack conversations into documentation, and helps resolve open documentation GitHub Issues.

## Day 5: Promptless Capture

**Automated screenshot updates when your UI changes**

Promptless Capture keeps product screenshots automatically in sync with your product. An AI agent navigates and interacts with your product, captures screenshots automatically, detects when UI changes make screenshots outdated, and regenerates them to match your existing cropping and annotation style.

On day one, Promptless audits your existing screenshots. When code changes impact a screenshot, Promptless detects which screenshots need updating and recreates them with your current UI. You can review and iterate on regenerated screenshots in the dashboard, including cropping, annotations, and highlighting using the built-in screenshot editor.
