title: "Announcing Promptless 1.0: Your Docs on Autopilot"
description: After a year of working with teams from startups to Fortune 500s, we're launching Promptless 1.0—built to keep documentation current without disrupting how your team works.
---

We've been working with teams for a year now—from fast-growing startups to Fortune 500 enterprises—helping them keep docs up to date without the usual headaches. Today we're officially launching Promptless 1.0.

Most teams struggle to keep docs current. Engineers ship features but don't have bandwidth for documentation. Technical writers chase down context across Slack, Jira, and GitHub. Support teams answer the same questions repeatedly because docs are outdated or incomplete.

Managing documentation is a challenging, multi-team effort that scales poorly as products grow. That's why we built Promptless.

## Documentation That Stays Current Automatically

Promptless monitors your software changes and team conversations to automatically draft documentation updates. When you merge a PR, answer a customer question in Slack, or resolve a support ticket, Promptless detects when docs need updating and creates suggestions for your review.

Promptless integrates into your Slack channels, GitHub repos, Jira issues, and documentation platform. No prompt engineering required—hence the name "Promptless."

Every suggestion prioritizes accuracy, simplicity, and discoverability. Promptless learns your documentation style by reading your entire docs site, existing style guides, and Vale rules, then matches that style in every update.

## Real Impact from Real Teams

Since launching a year ago, we've helped teams eliminate documentation debt.

**Vellum** (YC W23) uses Promptless to automatically turn Slack Connect customer conversations into documentation. When their team answers a customer question that should be covered in their public guides, Promptless drafts the update. Today, over 54% of Vellum's docs PRs originate from Promptless suggestions.

**Clay** uses Promptless to bridge the gap between their product team's biweekly changelogs and their content team's guides. Promptless automatically drafts new and updated guides whenever there's a product update.

A **Fortune 500 company** has full-time technical writers, but context for every change is spread across Linear, Confluence, and Slack. Promptless automatically assembles relevant context and drafts doc updates for every PR, making every technical writer twice as productive.

## The Journey to 1.0

Over the past year, we've shipped features that make documentation maintenance faster, more transparent, and more collaborative:

**Promptless Capture** keeps product screenshots automatically in sync with your product. When code changes impact a screenshot, Promptless detects which screenshots need updating and recreates them with your current UI. Review and iterate on regenerated screenshots in the dashboard with the built-in screenshot editor.

**Voice Match** creates custom fine-tuned models that match your documentation style. In benchmarks using real documentation updates, Voice Match eliminates 92% of AI-generated content that sounds unnatural. Your docs sound human-written because they're trained on your writing.

**Citations** provide transparency for every documentation update. See exactly which GitHub files, Slack threads, and customer conversations informed each change. When reviewing suggestions, you can verify sources and rationale for every line—solving the verification challenge with AI-generated content.

**Slack Listen** passively monitors any Slack channel you choose and automatically detects when conversations should become documentation updates. This works especially well for Slack Connect channels with customers or dedicated documentation discussion channels.

**Automatic CI Fixes** detect when documentation PRs fail CI checks or build tests and automatically push fixes. Promptless resolves linting errors, Vale warnings, broken links, and build issues without manual intervention.

**Auto-Merge for PRs** completes the end-to-end automation—from code changes to merged documentation. Enable auto-merge in project settings for complete hands-off documentation maintenance, ideal for internal docs or teams with high confidence in Promptless suggestions.

## What 1.0 Means

Promptless 1.0 represents maturity across the platform:

- **Enterprise-ready:** SOC 2 compliant, SSO support, self-hosted deployment options with Kubernetes/Helm
- **Production-proven:** Handling thousands of documentation updates monthly for teams of all sizes
- **Platform-complete:** Full integration ecosystem covering triggers, context sources, and publishing destinations
- **Reliability-focused:** Automatic error recovery, protected branch detection, comprehensive monitoring

We've also launched **Promptless for Open Source**, offering free licenses to CNCF, Linux Foundation, and Apache Software Foundation projects. Open-source maintainers face unique documentation challenges, and we want to help.

## What's Next

We're continuing to expand Promptless's capabilities:

- Enhanced multi-language support for global documentation teams
- Advanced workflow automation for complex review processes
- Deeper integration with more documentation platforms and tools
- AI-powered documentation analytics and insights
