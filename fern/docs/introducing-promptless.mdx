title: "Introducing Promptless 1.0: Your AI Teammate for Documentation"
description: Promptless automatically drafts documentation updates as you ship features and support customers, keeping your docs current without the constant overhead.
---

We launched Promptless 1.0 to solve a problem every team faces: keeping docs current is exhausting. Context gets lost in handoffs, updates lag behind releases, and support teams answer the same questions repeatedly because docs are always a step behind.

Promptless automatically drafts documentation updates based on your feature releases, support conversations, and internal discussions. It monitors your existing workflows and detects when documentation updates are needed—no prompt engineering required.

## How It Works

Promptless integrates with GitHub, Slack, Linear, Jira, Zendesk, and your documentation platform. When you merge a PR, respond to a customer in Slack, or close a support ticket, Promptless analyzes the context and drafts relevant documentation updates. You review and publish what makes sense.

It reads your entire docs site to understand your style and structure. Every documentation update includes citations showing exactly where information came from—specific GitHub files, Slack threads, or support conversations. You can verify sources and understand the reasoning behind each change.

## How Teams Use Promptless

**Vellum** (YC W23) has Slack Connect channels with key customers. They use Promptless to automatically turn customer support conversations into documentation updates. Today, over 50% of Vellum's docs PRs originate from Promptless, and 60% of their product and engineering team interacts with Promptless monthly to draft updates for features they own.

**Amplitude** uses Promptless to help their tech writers keep up with documentation demands. Their technical writers were drowning in work, so they integrated Promptless to draft documentation for every feature release. Now engineers review the first draft of docs before sending them to customers, making the entire process faster and more collaborative.

**Vitess**, a CNCF graduated project, proves Promptless works in the open-source world. Since installing Promptless, 94% of their documentation updates have been drafted with Promptless—the tool has become essential to keeping their docs current as the project evolves.

**Basis**, an AI agents platform for accounting ([ofbasis.com](https://ofbasis.com/)), uses Promptless for their entire knowledge base. Promptless processes all their meeting recordings and automatically updates customer pages, internal guides for their fast-growing team, and customer-facing documentation all at once.

**Fortune 500 companies** use Promptless to make technical writers more productive. Context is spread across Linear, Confluence, and Slack—Promptless automatically assembles the relevant information and drafts doc updates for every PR.

## What's Included in Promptless 1.0

**Voice Match:** Fine-tunes a custom model based on your existing documentation style, so AI-generated content sounds natural and matches your established tone.

**Promptless Capture:** Keeps product screenshots automatically in sync with your UI. When code changes impact a screenshot, Promptless detects which images need updating and regenerates them with your current interface.

**Screenshot Editor:** Edit screenshots directly in the dashboard—crop, annotate, highlight UI elements, or add shapes and text. Changes are immediately available in your docs.

**Slack Listen:** Passively monitors Slack channels you choose and automatically creates documentation suggestions when conversations become inactive. Perfect for Slack Connect customer channels or internal discussion threads.

**Promptless Citations:** See exactly where each documentation change came from. Every update includes references to the specific GitHub files, Slack threads, or support conversations that informed it.

**Auto-Merge for Documentation PRs:** When enabled, Promptless automatically merges documentation PRs as soon as they're created—complete end-to-end automation from code changes to merged documentation.
