# Jira Integration

**Used for: Context**

Promptless integrates with both Jira Cloud and Jira Data Center instances.

## Integration Types

Promptless supports two types of Jira integrations depending on your Jira deployment:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Jira Cloud" icon="fa-solid fa-cloud">
    For Atlassian-hosted Jira instances. Uses OAuth 2.0 authentication through Atlassian's secure connection process.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Jira Data Center (Beta)" icon="fa-solid fa-server">
    For self-hosted Jira Data Center installations. Uses username and password authentication with your organization's instance.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
Jira Data Center is in Beta. Please contact the Promptless team at [help@gopromptless.ai](mailto:help@gopromptless.ai) to connect your Jira Data Center instance to Promptless.
</Info>

## Jira Cloud Installation

For Atlassian Cloud-hosted Jira instances:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect Jira Cloud">
    Click "Connect Jira Cloud" from the [integrations page](https://app.gopromptless.ai/integrations).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Atlassian Login">
    If you're not already logged in, you'll see the Atlassian login screen:

</Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="OAuth Consent">
    Review the permissions Promptless is requesting on the OAuth consent screen:

</Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete Connection">
    Click "Accept" and verify the connection in Promptless. If you don't see the option to accept, you may not have the required permissions. Contact your Jira administrator or invite them to Promptless. For more information about adding new members, see our [Account Management](/docs/account-management) page.
  </Step>
</Steps>

After connecting, manage Promptless access by going to your avatar > Account settings > Connected apps in Atlassian:

## Project Setup and Permissions

After connecting Jira, you can configure which projects you'd like Promptless to search in when setting up a Project in the [projects page](https://app.gopromptless.ai/projects). Promptless will not search projects not specified here.

</Frame>

## JQL Search Capabilities

Promptless leverages Jira's powerful JQL (Jira Query Language) search functionality to find relevant context:

- **Automatic Issue Retrieval**: When a GitHub PR or other trigger mentions a Jira ticket (like "PROJ-123"), Promptless automatically retrieves that specific issue for additional context.

- **Proactive JQL Searches**: Promptless can proactively search Jira using JQL queries to find related issues, epics, and project data that might be relevant to the documentation being generated.

<Note>
Promptless queries Jira data in real-time and does not store any of your Jira data. All searches are performed on-demand when documentation updates are needed.
</Note>

## Provisioning a Jira Account for Promptless

We recommend creating a dedicated Jira account for Promptless so that Promptless can create Jira issues and you can track its work in your project management system.

Create the account using an email alias like `your_email+promptless@company.com`, or ask your IT admin to provision a new email account like `promptless@company.com`.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to User management">
    In Atlassian, go to your settings and select **User management** under Atlassian admin settings.
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="https://promptless-customer-doc-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/docs-images/org_2lvkgU9erOFxYhtEVVC0ymPrPdF/jira-user-management-settings-1761099982.png" alt="Atlassian admin settings showing User management option" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Invite the Promptless account">
    Click "Invite people" and enter the email address for your Promptless account. Under the Jira app, select the **User** role (not User access admin).

    </Frame>
    
    <Warning>
      When accepting the invite, make sure you're logged out of your person account, and logged into the Jira account you created for Promptless, otherwise this won't work.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Accept the invitation">
    Check your own email inbox (if you're using the alias), or Promptless's email inbox.
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="https://promptless-customer-doc-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/docs-images/org_2lvkgU9erOFxYhtEVVC0ymPrPdF/jira-email-invitation-1761099983.png" alt="Email invitation from Jira to join the team" />
    </Frame>
    
    When setting up the account, you can use the name "Promptless Bot".
    
    Once complete, you'll see the account listed as ACTIVE. It might take up to an hour for the status to update from INVITED to ACTIVE after you accept the invite.

    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect to Promptless">
    When connecting Jira in Promptless, make sure you're logged into the Jira account you created for Promptless (not your personal account) when completing the OAuth connection.
  </Step>
