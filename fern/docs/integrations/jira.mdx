# Atlassian Integration (Jira + Confluence)

**Used for: Context**

<Info>
Promptless integrates with both Jira and Confluence through a single OAuth connection. When engineers reference Jira issue keys in GitHub PRs or commit messages (like "PROJ-123"), Promptless automatically retrieves the ticket for context. Promptless also searches your Confluence spaces for existing patterns, terminology, and architectural decisions to keep new documentation consistent.
</Info>

<Note>
If you previously connected Jira to Promptless, reconnect to access Confluence spaces. Your existing Jira project configuration will be preserved.
</Note>

Promptless integrates with both Jira Cloud and Jira Data Center instances.

## Integration Types

Promptless supports two types of Jira integrations depending on your Jira deployment:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Jira Cloud" icon="fa-solid fa-cloud">
    For Atlassian-hosted Jira instances. Uses OAuth 2.0 authentication through Atlassian's secure connection process.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Jira Data Center (Beta)" icon="fa-solid fa-server">
    For self-hosted Jira Data Center installations. Uses username and password authentication with your organization's instance.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
Jira Data Center is in Beta. Please contact the Promptless team at [help@gopromptless.ai](mailto:help@gopromptless.ai) to connect your Jira Data Center instance to Promptless.

## What You Can Do with Atlassian

Once connected, you can use Jira and Confluence as context sources to enhance documentation suggestions:

- **Jira**: Automatically retrieve ticket information and search for related issues using JQL queries. See the [Jira Context Source](/docs/configuration/context-sources/jira) page for details.
- **Confluence**: Search your Confluence spaces for existing documentation patterns, terminology, and architectural decisions. See the [Confluence Context Source](/docs/configuration/context-sources/confluence) page for details.

## Provisioning an Atlassian Account for Promptless

We recommend creating a dedicated Atlassian account for Promptless to access both Jira and Confluence. A dedicated account gives you complete audit trail visibility and lets you configure fine-grained permissions for both services.

Create the account using an email alias like `your_email+promptless@company.com`, or ask your IT admin to provision a new email account like `promptless@company.com`.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to User management">
    In Atlassian, go to your settings and select **User management** under Atlassian admin settings.

    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Invite the Promptless account">
    Click "Invite people" and enter the email address for your Promptless account. Under the Jira app, select the **User** role (not User access admin).

    </Frame>
    
    <Warning>
      When accepting the invite, make sure you're logged out of your personal account, and logged into the Jira account you created for Promptless, otherwise this won't work.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Accept the invitation">
    Check your own email inbox (if you're using the alias), or Promptless's email inbox.

    </Frame>
    
    When setting up the account, you can use the name "Promptless Bot".
    
    Once complete, you'll see the account listed as ACTIVE. It might take up to an hour for the status to update from INVITED to ACTIVE after you accept the invite.

## Data Processing and Security

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I restrict Promptless from accessing confidential Jira projects or Confluence spaces?">
    Promptless inherits the permissions of the Atlassian account used during OAuth connection. There are several ways to manage access depending on your security requirements:

    **Standard approach:** After connecting Atlassian, configure which Jira projects and Confluence spaces Promptless should search in your [project settings](https://app.gopromptless.ai/projects). Promptless won't access projects or spaces you don't explicitly configure, even if the connected account has permission to see them.

    **For highly confidential content:** Create an Atlassian user account that only has access to non-confidential projects and spaces, then connect Atlassian to Promptless using this limited-access account. This restricts access at the Atlassian permissions level, adding an extra security layer.

    **For granular control:** [Provision a dedicated Atlassian account for Promptless](#provisioning-an-atlassian-account-for-promptless) and configure fine-grained permissions for both Jira projects and Confluence spaces in Atlassian's user management before connecting it to Promptless.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Promptless actions are attributed to my personal account">
    - Disconnect Atlassian from the [integrations page](https://app.gopromptless.ai/integrations)
    - Sign out of your personal Atlassian account in your browser
    - Sign in to the Promptless bot account you created
    - Reconnect Atlassian to Promptless while signed in to the bot account
