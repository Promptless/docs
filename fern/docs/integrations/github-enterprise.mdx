# GitHub Enterprise Setup

**For GitHub Enterprise Server and GitHub Enterprise Cloud users**

If your organization uses GitHub Enterprise Server (self-hosted) or GitHub Enterprise Cloud with specific security requirements, you'll need to create a custom GitHub App within your enterprise environment to integrate with Promptless.

<Warning>
This setup is required for GitHub Enterprise Server instances and GitHub Enterprise Cloud organizations that don't allow third-party GitHub Apps. For standard GitHub.com organizations, use the [standard GitHub integration](/docs/integrations/github-integration) instead.
</Warning>

## Prerequisites

- GitHub Enterprise admin access to create and configure GitHub Apps
- Network access to Promptless endpoints (see [IP whitelisting](#ip-whitelisting) section)
- Ability to generate and securely store private keys and client secrets

## Step 1: Register New GitHub App

1. Navigate to your GitHub Enterprise admin settings
2. Go to "GitHub Apps" and click "New GitHub App"

## Step 6: IP Whitelisting

Add Promptless IP addresses to your network whitelist to ensure proper connectivity:

<Info>
If your GitHub Enterprise instance is behind a firewall or uses IP restrictions, you must whitelist these IP addresses for Promptless to function properly.
</Info>

### Promptless IP Addresses

Add the following IP addresses to your whitelist:

```
3.143.177.103
3.131.121.250
3.13.184.175
18.223.104.40
```

<Warning>
These IP addresses are required for webhook delivery and API communication. Failure to whitelist them will prevent Promptless from receiving GitHub events and accessing your repositories.
</Warning>

<Info>
The primary egress IP address for Promptless infrastructure is `3.143.177.103` (NAT gateway). This is the IP address that will appear in your GitHub Enterprise logs for API requests.
</Info>

## Step 7: Generate Credentials

After configuring all settings, generate the necessary credentials:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate Private Key">
    1. Scroll to the bottom of the GitHub App settings page
    2. Click "Generate a private key"
    3. Download and securely store the `.pem` file
    4. This key will be needed for Promptless configuration
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate Client Secret">
    1. In the "Client secrets" section, click "Generate a new client secret"
    2. Copy and securely store the generated secret
    3. This secret will be needed for OAuth authentication
  </Step>

  <Step title="Note the App ID">
    1. Find the "App ID" at the top of the settings page
    2. Record this ID as it will be needed for configuration
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Store the private key and client secret in a secure location. These credentials provide access to your GitHub Enterprise instance and should be treated as highly sensitive information.
</Warning>

## Step 8: Install the App

1. After creating the GitHub App, install it to your organization or specific repositories
2. Choose which repositories Promptless should have access to
3. Complete the installation process

## Step 9: Configure Promptless
