## Project Setup and Permissions

After connecting Linear, configure which teams Promptless can search when setting up a Project on the [projects page](https://app.gopromptless.ai/projects). Promptless only searches teams you select. 

In the example below, Promptless only searches within the `PRO` team for relevant issues.
