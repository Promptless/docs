title: Adding Repositories
---

After the initial installation, you may need to add new repositories or modify which repositories Promptless can access. You can manage this directly through your GitHub organization settings:

1. Navigate to your GitHub organization settings
2. Go to "Third-party Access" → "GitHub Apps"
3. Find "Promptless" in the list and click "Configure"
4. In the "Repository access" section, you can switch between "All repositories" and "Only select repositories," add specific repositories using the dropdown, or remove repositories by clicking the "×" next to their names
5. Click "Save" to apply your changes

After updating repository access, the new repositories will be available when creating or editing projects in Promptless. It may take a few minutes for changes to appear—click the refresh icon on the integrations page if you don't see newly added repositories right away.
