## Authentication Model

Promptless uses Zendesk's [official OAuth 2.0 authentication](https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/introduction/security-and-auth/), which provides:

- Secure token-based authentication
- Granular API access scopes
- Ability to revoke access at any time
- Regular token rotation for enhanced security

## What You Can Do with Zendesk

Once connected, you can use Zendesk as a [trigger source](/docs/triggers/zendesk-tickets-beta) to monitor resolved support tickets for documentation gaps (Beta).
