# Intercom Integration

**Used for: Publishing**

Promptless supports publishing documentation directly to Intercom. This integration allows you to manage your Intercom help center content through the Promptless platform.

## Setup

To set up the Intercom integration:

1. Configure your Intercom credentials in the Promptless dashboard
2. Select Intercom as your documentation platform when creating a new project

## What You Can Do with Intercom

Once connected, you can use Intercom as a [documentation platform](/docs/configuration/doc-collections/intercom) to publish help center articles and customer support documentation.

<Note>
The Intercom integration creates or updates drafts in Intercom. You'll need to review and publish these drafts from within your Intercom dashboard before they become visible to your users.
</Note>

<Note>
Intercom is currently supported only as a publishing destination. Support for using Intercom as a context source or trigger may be added in the future.
</Note>

For any questions or issues with the Intercom integration, please contact our support team at [help@gopromptless.ai](mailto:help@gopromptless.ai).
