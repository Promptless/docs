# Intercom Integration

**Used for: Publishing**

Promptless integrates with Intercom to update documentation directly in your help center.

## Setup

1. Click **Connect** next to Intercom from the [Integrations page](https://app.gopromptless.ai/integrations)
2. Authorize Promptless to access your Intercom workspace

## What You Can Do with Intercom

Once connected, you can use Intercom as a [documentation platform](/docs/configuration/doc-collections/intercom) to publish help center articles and customer support documentation.

<Note>
The Intercom integration creates or updates drafts in Intercom. You'll need to review and publish these drafts from your Intercom dashboard before they become visible to users.
</Note>

## Future Capabilities

We're exploring additional Intercom features:

- **Context source**: Search your existing help center articles
- **Trigger**: Detect documentation gaps from support conversations
