# Slack Integration

**Used for: Triggers**

Promptless integrates with Slack through our official Slack App. This enables automated documentation updates based on team communication.

## Installation

1. Click "Connect Slack" from the [integrations page](https://app.gopromptless.ai/integrations).

3. Review and approve the requested permissions. Promptless requires these permissions to trigger from Slack events and notify your team when updates are available.

<Info title="Understanding Slack Permissions">
  Promptless requests broader permissions than it currently uses. This supports potential future features like searching across Slack threads for context. Currently, Promptless only accesses threads when you tag @Promptless or use the "Update Docs" message action. It does not monitor or read channels.

4. Verify that Slack is connected in the integrations page.

## Project Setup and Permissions

After installing the Slack app, configure projects on the [projects page](https://app.gopromptless.ai/projects) to trigger from Slack. 

Below is an example project configured to trigger from Slack.

Once created, trigger Promptless by writing @Promptless in a Slack channel or by clicking the "Update Docs" message action on any thread. Promptless pulls the entire thread and identifies documentation updates based on its contents. 

<Warning title="Privacy and Channel Access">
  Promptless only reads Slack content when you explicitly trigger it. It does not monitor, scan, or automatically read messages. Promptless cannot access private channels unless invited.
</Warning> 

## Image Processing in Slack Threads

Promptless processes images shared in Slack threads when triggered. This enhances documentation with visual elements when appropriate.

### How It Works

1. Tag @Promptless or use "Update docs" in a thread with images. Promptless analyzes both text and images.

2. Promptless evaluates whether images provide valuable context for documentation.

3. If an image is relevant, Promptless:
   - Uploads it to a secure S3 bucket
   - Includes it in documentation suggestions
   - Formats it appropriately for your platform

4. Review added images at the bottom of the review interface. Approve or reject their inclusion.

### Managing Images

Manage images through the Promptless dashboard:

1. Navigate to the Change History page for the documentation update
2. Scroll to the Created Assets section
3. From here:
   - View a preview of each image
   - Copy the URL to use elsewhere
   - Delete if no longer needed

**Important:** Deleting an image permanently removes it from database and storage. Manually update any documentation references to deleted images.

### Permission Requirements

This feature requires additional Slack permissions. If you installed the Slack app before this feature was released, reinstall it:

1. Go to the [integrations page](https://app.gopromptless.ai/integrations)
2. Delete the existing Slack integration
3. Re-add the Slack app to grant new permissions

**Note:** Image processing only supports images directly shared in Slack threads. External images are not automatically processed.

## Permission Scope and Usage

### What Promptless Does

Promptless operates on an **explicit trigger model**:

- **Only reads when triggered**: Accesses Slack messages only when you tag @Promptless or use "Update Docs"
- **Thread-based processing**: Reads the entire thread to understand context, but only that specific thread
- **No background monitoring**: Does not scan, monitor, or automatically read messages

### Why Broader Permissions Are Requested

The Slack app requests broader permissions to support potential future features:

- **Future search capabilities**: Permission scope designed to potentially search across Slack threads for context
- **Customer-requested features**: Some customers requested the ability to search historical Slack conversations
- **Optional future functionality**: Any new features would be **opt-in configuration options** you control

## Authentication Model

Promptless uses Slack's [official App authentication](https://api.slack.com/authentication):

- OAuth 2.0 token-based authentication
- Granular permission scopes
- Revoke access at workspace or channel level
- Regular token rotation
