# Integrations

Promptless offers several key integrations to help automate and improve your documentation workflow.

Integrations can be used for:
1. Triggers (i.e. to generate events, either automatically or manually, upon which Promptless gets notified)
2. Context (i.e. to allow Promptless to search for relevant information in its research)
3. Publishing (i.e. to push documentation updates to your Git-hosted docs)

Some integrations can be used for multiple purposes. Some integrations are in a beta state and may not be listed here. For the most up to date list of integrations, please contact us at help@gopromptless.ai.

## Managing Integrations

Organization administrators can view and manage all connected integrations from the [Integrations page](https://app.gopromptless.ai/integrations) in the Promptless dashboard.

The Integrations page shows:
- All currently connected integrations for your organization
- Connection status and authentication state for each integration
- Options to disconnect or reconfigure integrations
- Links to set up new integrations

To revoke access for any integration, click the integration card and select the disconnect option. This immediately revokes Promptless's access to that service.

## Security & Authentication

All Promptless integrations follow security best practices:
- OAuth 2.0 authentication where applicable
- Encrypted data transmission (TLS 1.2+)
- Encrypted data storage (AES-256)
- Minimal data retention

## Common Features

Each integration includes:
- Granular permission controls
- Audit logging capabilities
- Configurable notification settings
- Data privacy controls

For detailed security information, visit our [Security and Privacy documentation](/docs/security-and-privacy).
