# Integrations

Promptless offers several key integrations to help automate and improve your documentation workflow. 

Integrations can be used for: 
1. Triggers (i.e. to generate events, either automatically or manually, upon which Promptless gets notified)
2. Context (i.e. to allow Promptless to search for relevant information in its research)
3. Publishing (i.e. to push documentation updates to a given platform)

Some integrations can be used for multiple purposes. Some integrations are in a beta state and may not be listed here. For the most up to date list of integrations, please contact us at help@gopromptless.ai.
