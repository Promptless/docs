# GitHub Integration

**Used for: Triggers, Context, and Publishing**

Promptless integrates with GitHub through our official GitHub App. This provides secure access to your repositories for documentation automation.

<Info>
**GitHub Enterprise Users**: If you're using GitHub Enterprise Server or GitHub Enterprise Cloud with restricted third-party app access, see our [GitHub Enterprise Setup Guide](/docs/integrations/github-enterprise-integration).

5. Click "Save"

Changes may take a few minutes to appear in your Promptless dashboard. If you don't see newly added repositories immediately, click the "refresh repos" icon on the integrations page.

## Project Setup and Permissions

After setup, create a project on the [projects page](https://app.gopromptless.ai/projects). Select trigger repositories and documentation repositories. Promptless has read-only access to trigger repositories and write access to documentation repositories.

In the example below, Promptless can only read the `promptless` and `promptless-dashboard` repos, but can read and write to the `promptless-docs` repo.

## Trigger Events in Pull Request Descriptions

Promptless automatically includes trigger events in pull request descriptions. This provides context for reviewers and creates clear traceability.

The trigger events section includes:
- Links to the original source (Slack threads, GitHub PRs, support tickets)
- Brief descriptions of what triggered the update
- Easy navigation to review the context

This helps you understand why changes were made and provides an audit trail.

## Directory-Specific Triggers

Configure Promptless to trigger only on changes to specific directories. This focuses documentation updates on specific parts of your codebase, such as changelog directories.

To set up directory-specific triggers:

1. When creating or editing a project, select the GitHub trigger option
2. Check "Choose specific directories to trigger this project"
3. Enter the directory paths to monitor (separate multiple paths with commas)
4. Save your configuration

</Frame>

Once configured, trigger directories appear in the project list view.

When specified, only PRs with changes to those directories trigger documentation updates. Other file changes are ignored. 

## Authentication Model

Promptless uses the official [GitHub App specification](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/about-creating-github-apps). Authentication uses JWTs generated by the GitHub App installation.
