# ClickUp Integration

**Used for: Context**

Promptless integrates with ClickUp to access your project management data for documentation automation.

## Installation

1. Click "Connect ClickUp" from the [integrations page](https://app.gopromptless.ai/integrations).
2. You'll be redirected to ClickUp to authorize Promptless to access your workspace.
3. Select the workspace you want to connect and approve the requested permissions.
4. Once authorized, you'll be redirected back to Promptless and can verify that ClickUp is connected.

## Project Setup and Permissions

After connecting ClickUp, configure which spaces or lists Promptless can search within when setting up a Project in the [projects page](https://app.gopromptless.ai/projects). Promptless will only search within the spaces you select.

For example, you can configure Promptless to search only within specific ClickUp spaces for relevant tasks.

## Authentication Model

Promptless uses ClickUp's OAuth 2.0 authentication, which provides:

- Secure token-based authentication
- Workspace-level permissions
- Ability to revoke access at any time
- Granular control over which spaces Promptless can access
