# Google Drive Integration (Beta)

**Used for: Context**

Promptless offers beta support for accessing documents in Google Drive to provide additional context for documentation automation. Contact help@gopromptless.ai for access to this integration.

## Setup

To set up the Google Drive integration:

1. Contact us at help@gopromptless.ai to enable the integration for your account
2. Authorize Promptless to access your Google Drive
3. Select which folders or documents Promptless can access for context
4. Configure your settings in the Promptless dashboard

## How It Works

When triggered, Promptless can search your authorized Google Drive folders for relevant context like:

- Design documents
- Product specifications
- Requirements documents
- Meeting notes and other documentation

This helps Promptless create more accurate and comprehensive documentation updates.

## Limitations

As this is a beta feature:
- Only specific document types are supported (Google Docs, PDFs, text files)
- Large folders may require additional configuration
- Access permissions are managed at the folder level

For any questions or issues with the Google Drive integration, please contact our support team at help@gopromptless.ai.
