Promptless can support a variety of use-cases for open source projects, such as automatically updating developer docs, writing changelogs or release notes for new versions, automatically handling localization and translations, and more.

The needs of open-source projects are often different from the needs for typical commercial software companies, so we have tailor-made features and recommended set-ups specifically for open-source projects. 

## Quick Start

The basic set-up for your open-source project involves:
1. Installing the Promptless Github app. (integrations page)

Some guidance on which Github app to install: 
* If you can install apps that require write permissions on your repo, and want Promptless to make branches and PRs directly on your repo, install the standard Github app. 
* If you need to install an app that only needs read-permissions on your repo, install the Github OSS app. Note: when you do this, Promptless will create branches on a fork of your docs repo, and will make PRs using that fork. 

2. Setting up Doc Collections

You can create multiple Doc Collections if necessary. For example, if you've got a changelog in a different location from your main docs, then you should create two Docs Locations so Promptless can update both. 

You can specify a particular directory that Promptless should update docs in—e.g. if you have docs in a monorepo with code for your project. 

3. Set up projects 

When creating projects, tell Promptless which repos you want Promptless to listen to PRs from, and which docs to update. 


We highly recommend checking the box for Promptless to run on the last 30 days of PRs, so that you can get an initial batch of doc updates that you can calibrate Promptless with. 

Many open-source projects want to centralize their operations in Github, so that anyone can benefit from Promptless without having a Promptless acconut. In that case, ensure that you have the "Auto-create PR" option checked. We highly recommend turning on this setting after doing the initial calibration, though. 

Most users set Promptless to run whenever there's a PR opened. However, with popular open-source projects where there are a lot of unverified contributor PRs that end up closed, it might make more sense for Promptless to be triggered on Github Commits on your default branch, so it only runs when PRs are merged. Again, we recommend changing this setting after the initial calibration. 

For translation workflows, you might want the trigger repo to be the english directory of your docs, and then Promptless will draft updates that update the rest of your docs. 

If Github Issues are part of your workflow, make sure to create a Github Issues trigger, so that contributors can tag Promptless in their repos to generate doc updates. 

Coming soon: for some use-cases with monorepos, you might want Promptless to add a docs commit into your existing PRs, rather than create fresh docs PR. If you're interested in this feature, contact us at help@gopromptless.ai
