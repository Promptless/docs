title: Promptless for Open Source
---

Promptless automatically drafts documentation updates for open source projects when code changes—no write access to your repository required.

## How It Works

When contributors open pull requests, Promptless analyzes the changes and suggests documentation updates. Since open source projects typically can't install GitHub apps with write access, Promptless uses a fork-based approach:

1. Promptless maintains a fork of your documentation repository
2. When documentation updates are needed, the `promptless-for-oss` service account creates a PR from that fork to your upstream repository
3. You review and merge the PR just like any other community contribution

Documentation PRs appear in your repository alongside other contributor PRs, maintaining full visibility for your maintainer team.

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an account">
    Sign up at [accounts.gopromptless.ai](https://accounts.gopromptless.ai)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Connect GitHub (OSS)">
    On the [integrations page](https://app.gopromptless.ai/integrations), find the **GitHub (OSS)** card and click **Connect GitHub (OSS)**. This installs a read-only GitHub app that monitors your repositories without requiring write access.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select your repositories">
    Choose which open source repositories you want Promptless to monitor for documentation updates.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set up a doc collection">
    Tell Promptless where your documentation lives by creating a doc collection. This could be a `/docs` folder in the same repo, a separate docs repository, or a documentation platform like Fern or Docusaurus. See [Doc Collections](/docs/configuration/doc-collections) for details.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Once configured, Promptless monitors your selected repositories. When a PR is opened, it analyzes the changes and opens a documentation PR from a fork if updates are needed.
