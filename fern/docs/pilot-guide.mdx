# Your Promptless Pilot

Promptless offers pilot periods for enterprise customers. This pilot period allows you to see how Promptless works with your own documentation, team workflows, and trigger events. The pilot period is 30 days. Below you'll get a sense of what you can expect during your Promptless pilot. 

## Why 30 Days?

The 30-day pilot lets you:

- See Promptless handle different types of documentation updates
- Evaluate suggestion quality across different scenarios
- Integrate Promptless into your team's workflow

<Info>
Your pilot starts when Promptless creates your first suggestion—not when you sign up. Therefore, any time that's spent getting approvals for data source connections doesn't count against your pilot.
</Info>

## Before Your Pilot Begins

Before the pilot begins, you'll need to set up Promptless connectors and share resources with the Promptless team so that the Promptless agent can draft an initial batch of suggestions. 

### Setting up Promptless Connectors

Connect Promptless to your key systems:

- **Source code repositories**: GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket
- **Communication platforms**: Slack or Microsoft Teams  
- **Project management tools**: Jira or Linear (optional but recommended for better context)

See our [Setup & Quickstart guide](/docs/getting-started/setup-quickstart) for integration instructions.

### Set Up Slack Connect

We'll create a shared Slack Connect channel between your team and ours for questions, feedback, and quick support throughout your pilot.

### Share Your Documentation Context

Share information about your docs to help Promptless match your team's standards:

- Your style guide
- Vale configuration (if you use it)
- Documentation standards or templates
- Information you'd share with a new technical writer joining your team

## Onboarding Workshop

Every pilot starts with an onboarding workshop—even for fully remote teams, we'll work with whoever will be using Promptless most.

    90-minute session. For larger teams, we may split this into multiple workshops over a few days.

  <Card title="Preparation" icon="fa-regular fa-list-check">
    Before your session, we run Promptless on historical events (like the last 30 days of PRs) so you can review real suggestions during the workshop.

    Review your configuration and how triggers, context sources, and publishing work for your team
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish your first updates">
    Review suggestions together and publish documentation updates during the session
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define success criteria">
    Agree on metrics to evaluate whether Promptless is working for your team
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Measuring Success

Based on onboarding dozens of teams, we recommend two success criteria:

### Suggestion Volume

Track how many suggestions you're getting from Promptless. More isn't necessarily better—a one-line correction and a new feature article are both valuable but different.

**Volume benchmarks:**
- Teams with 0-1 people working full-time on docs: 20-40 suggestions per month
- Teams with 2-5 technical writers: 30-60 suggestions per month

### Suggestion Quality

Rate Promptless suggestions on a scale from 0 to 10. 

**Quality target:** Promptless should consistently rate at least 8/10 for your team's needs.

<Tip>
During your workshop, we'll discuss what "quality" means for your team—technical accuracy, style guide compliance, or catching edge cases. Understanding your quality criteria helps us make Promptless better for you.
</Tip>

## Documentation Improvement Projects

Sometimes teams need foundational work before a pilot—like documenting major missing features, completing a large refactor, or creating documentation from scratch.

Subject to availability, the Promptless team may be able to help with these projects before your pilot begins. Contact us at [hello@gopromptless.ai](mailto:hello@gopromptless.ai) to discuss your needs.

## Weekly Check-ins

After your onboarding workshop, we schedule 15-30 minute check-ins to track progress and address issues.

**What we review:**
- How many suggestions did Promptless create?
- How would you rate suggestion quality this week (0-10)?
- What's the gap between current suggestions and 10/10 quality?
- How is Promptless fitting into your workflows? Is it triggering at the right times?

These check-ins help us identify and fix issues, adjust your configuration, and make sure you're getting value from Promptless.
