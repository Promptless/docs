# Your Promptless Pilot

Promptless offers pilot periods for enterprise customers. This pilot period allows you to see how Promptless works with your own documentation, team workflows, and trigger events. The pilot period is 30 days. Below you'll get a sense of what you can expect during your Promptless pilot. 


The 30-day pilot lets you:

- See Promptless handle different types of documentation updates
- Evaluate suggestion quality across different scenarios
- See how well Promptless can integrate into your team's workflow

<Info>
Your pilot starts when Promptless creates your first suggestion—not when you sign up. Therefore, any time that's spent getting approvals for data source connections doesn't count against your pilot.
</Info>

## Before Your Pilot Begins

Before the pilot begins, you'll need to connect Promptless to your relevant workspaces and share resources with the Promptless team so that the Promptless agent can draft an initial batch of suggestions. 

### Setting up Promptless Connectors

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect source code repositories">
    Connect GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, or Bitbucket
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect documentation platforms">
    Connect your documentation CMS or publishing platform, whether on Github (e.g. if you use Mintlify, Fern, Readme, Docusaurus, etc) or on a CMS like Zendesk.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Connect communication platforms">
    Connect Slack or Microsoft Teams to get notified about new suggestions and to tag Promptless in threads or messages to request doc updates directly
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Connect project management tools (optional)">
    Connect Jira or Linear—this is optional, but recommended to give Promptless better context about the customer-facing impact of new features
  </Step>
</Steps>

See our [Setup & Quickstart guide](/docs/getting-started/setup-quickstart) for integration instructions.

### Set Up Slack Connect

We'll create a shared Slack Connect channel between your team and ours for questions, feedback, and quick support throughout your pilot.

### Share Your Documentation Context

Promptless works best when it has the same sort of information that you'd give to a new technical writer joining your team. 

This can include:

- Your style guide
- Vale configuration (if you use it)
- Documentation standards or templates

## In-Person Onboarding Workshop

We always recommend kicking off customer pilots with an in-person workshop.

  <Step title="Publish your first updates">
    Review suggestions together and publish documentation updates during the session
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define success criteria">
    Agree on what a successful pilot with Promptless would look like for your team
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Measuring Success for your Pilot

During the workshop, we will define the success criteria for your pilot. This can vary based on each team's individual needs, but based on our experience onboarding dozens of teams, *suggestion volume* and *suggestion quality* are the most reliable indicators that your team will have a positive experience with Promptless going forward.

### Suggestion Volume

Track how many suggestions you're getting from Promptless. More suggestions isn't necessarily better—sometimes too many suggestions can feel noisy or overwhelming—but a healthy stream of documentation suggestions is a strong indicator that Promptless is plugged into the right parts of your workflow. 

<Info title="Typical volume benchmarks">
**Teams with 0-1 people working full-time on docs:** 20-40 suggestions per month

**Teams with 2-5 technical writers:** 30-100 suggestions per month

For larger teams, target volume will be highly dependent on how your team is organized, and it might be more important to have target volumes for each product or product vertical that your team supports. 
</Info>

<Info>
If Promptless isn't able to generate 20 suggestions a month, your team may be too early to see enough value from Promptless. 
</Info>

### Suggestion Quality

Since everyone has different expectations for Promptless, suggestion quality is simply measured by your rating of Promptless's suggestions, on a scale from 0 to 10. 

**Quality target:** Promptless should consistently rate at least 8/10 for your team's needs.

<Tip>
During your workshop, we'll discuss what "quality" means for your team—technical accuracy, style guide compliance, or catching edge cases. Understanding your quality criteria helps us make Promptless better for you.
</Tip>

#### Understanding Quality Ratings

To help you calibrate what different quality levels mean for your team:

* **"9-10":** Most suggestions from Promptless are relevant, and typically can be accepted with little to no edits.
* **"7-8":** Most suggestions are accurate and relevant, requiring only moderate editing. You're refining style, adding specific details, or adjusting tone rather than rewriting entire sections. Promptless meaningfully reduces your documentation workload.
* **"4-6":** Suggestions occasionally catch relevant changes and can serve as a starting point, but require significant editing. You're rewriting content, fixing inaccuracies, or filling in missing context. Promptless saves some time, but doesn't dramatically change your workflow.
* **"0-3":** Promptless is creating negative value. Most/all suggestions are not good enough to be a useful starting point for doc updates. Even if it's occasionally bringing up things that are relevant, I'd rather start from scratch myself.

## Documentation Improvement Projects

Sometimes teams need foundational work before piloting—like documenting major missing features, completing a large refactor, or creating documentation from scratch.

Subject to availability, the Promptless team may be able to help with these projects before your pilot begins. 

## Weekly Check-ins

After your onboarding workshop, we schedule 15-30 minute check-ins to track progress and address issues.

**What we review:**
- How many suggestions did Promptless create?
- How would you rate suggestion quality this week (0-10)?
- What's the gap between current suggestions and 10/10 quality?
- How is Promptless fitting into your workflows? Is it triggering at the right times?

These check-ins help us identify and fix issues, adjust your configuration, and make sure you're getting value from Promptless.
