# Frequently Asked Questions

Here you'll find answers to common questions about using Promptless.

## Getting Started & Onboarding

### How do I create an account? 

You can sign up for an account at [accounts.gopromptless.ai](https://accounts.gopromptless.ai). During signup, you'll go through a brief onboarding experience that asks about your documentation size, platforms, and preferred trigger events to help us recommend the right plan for your team.

### What happens during onboarding?

The onboarding process helps us understand your documentation needs through a few quick questions:

- **Documentation size**: Approximately how many articles are in your docs
- **Documentation platforms**: Where your docs are hosted (GitHub, Readme, Intercom, Zendesk, Webflow, etc.)
- **Trigger preferences**: What events should trigger documentation updates (GitHub PRs, Slack messages, support tickets, etc.)

Based on your answers, you'll either be directed to:
- **Self-serve checkout** for the Startup Plan (< 200 articles, GitHub/ReadMe docs, GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket PR or Slack triggers) with a 7-day trial
- **Discovery call booking** for the Enterprise Plan (larger documentation sets or custom requirements)

### Can I skip the onboarding process?

If you're directed to book a discovery call, you have the option to skip and proceed directly to the Promptless dashboard. However, completing the onboarding helps us provide better support and ensures you're set up for success. 

## Account Management
