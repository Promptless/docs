## Platform Usage

### What platforms does Promptless integrate with?

Promptless integrates with a wide variety of platforms for triggers, context, and publishing:

- **Triggers**: GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab, Slack, Microsoft Teams, Zendesk
- **Context Sources**: Linear, Jira, GitHub Issues, Google Drive
- **Publishing**: GitHub-synced docs (Fern, Mintlify, Docusaurus, etc.), ReadMe, Zendesk, Intercom, Webflow, Notion (beta)

For a complete list, see our [Integrations overview](/docs/integrations).

### Does Promptless monitor my Slack channels?

By default, no. Promptless only accesses Slack content when you explicitly trigger it by tagging @Promptless or using the "Update Docs" message action.

However, you can optionally enable **passive listening** for specific channels. When enabled, Promptless will monitor only the channels you explicitly select in your project configuration. This is completely opt-in - you choose which channels to monitor and can add or remove channels at any time. If you don't enable this option, we will not be monitoring any slack channels.

For more details, see our [Slack Integration documentation](/docs/integrations/slack-integration) and [Working with Slack](/docs/features/slack-interactions#4-passive-channel-listening).

### How can I trigger Promptless from Slack?

You can trigger Promptless from Slack in three ways:

- **Message Actions**: Click the three dots (⋯) on any message and select "Update Docs" 
- **Channel Mentions**: Tag @Promptless in any channel with your instructions
- **Direct Messages**: Send a DM to the Promptless bot with your request

For detailed instructions and examples, see [Working with Slack](/docs/features/slack-interactions).

### How does Promptless handle my data?

Promptless follows strict data handling practices:
- Documentation copies are stored for processing
- Third-party integration data is processed but not stored
- End-user data is not processed
- All data is encrypted in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest (AES-256)

For detailed information, see our [Data Handling documentation](/docs/security-and-privacy/data-handling-and-classification).

### Can I use Promptless with GitHub Enterprise?

Yes! Promptless supports both GitHub Enterprise Server and GitHub Enterprise Cloud. You can either use our standard GitHub App or set up a custom GitHub App for organizations with third-party app restrictions.

See our [GitHub Enterprise Integration guide](/docs/integrations/github-enterprise-integration) for setup instructions.
