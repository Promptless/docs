# How Vellum uses Promptless to draft over 50% of their doc updates

[Vellum](https://vellum.ai/) serves both technical and non-technical users with a flexible product, and keeping docs up to date was a constant challenge. After adopting Promptless 6 months ago, Vellum significantly reduced the effort needed to maintain their docs. Today, over 50% of new doc updates come directly from Promptless.

## The Challenge

Vellum faced roadblocks keeping docs up to date as their product evolved.

The engineering team shipped new features daily. Engineers would hand off features to a "docs owner" for documentation, but important context got lost in those transitions. Docs would get delayed, affecting customers.

Vellum's high-touch support style meant they had many Slack Connect channels with users. The product team was highly responsive, but customers repeatedly asked similar questions—from troubleshooting help to guidance on building specialized use-cases.

The team knew covering these troubleshooting scenarios and use-case guides in their docs would benefit customers. But the context switching from customer support to documentation writing meant it was always deferred.

Vellum needed to reduce the cycle from feature development and customer support to documentation publishing. This would let them scale product velocity and their customer base without compromising onboarding and customer experience.

## How Promptless Helped

When Promptless onboarded, it read through all of Vellum's existing docs, building up its own understanding of Vellum's products and documentation style. This meant Promptless was ready to generate doc updates that matched how Vellum's team wrote.

Promptless created changelog entries and scanned every relevant section of the docs to identify updates. It would proactively find and fix missing updates or inconsistencies across older docs. Code snippets and UI walkthroughs were auto-generated from Slack snippets and screenshots, letting users get what they needed without digging through API references.

Promptless automatically turned casual troubleshooting tips and questions answered in Slack Connect support channels into polished examples in Vellum's docs. In the last month, 54% of Vellum's docs PRs originated from Promptless suggestions.

## Scaling Documentation Across the Team

Since Promptless learns by reading existing articles, any engineer at Vellum could request docs updates for features they owned. Promptless had a prior understanding of Vellum's docs, so its suggestions required minimal edits. The cycle between feature completion and doc readiness was dramatically reduced.

Now, 60% of Vellum's product and engineering team interacts with Promptless to draft doc updates every month. Getting feature-owners directly involved in doc updates means details don't get lost in transition. Promptless enforces Vellum's tone and structure automatically, removing the need for rigid style checklists.

## What's Next

Vellum is exploring new ways for Promptless to improve their customer experience. The latest use-case is getting Promptless to generate personalized summaries of product updates for key clients, since Promptless is already well-versed in product updates and customer use-cases.
