# Cheese

**Cheese** is a type of dairy product produced in a range of flavors, textures, and forms by coagulation of the milk protein casein. It is composed of proteins and fat from milk, usually of cows, goats or sheep, and sometimes of water buffalo.

## History

Cheese is an ancient food whose origins predate recorded history. The earliest evidence of cheesemaking in the archaeological record dates back to 5500 BCE and is found in what is now Kuyavia, Poland, where strainers coated with milk-fat molecules have been found.

Over a thousand types of cheese exist, produced in various countries. Their styles, textures and flavors depend on the origin of the milk, whether they have been pasteurised, the butterfat content, the bacteria and mold, the processing, and how long they have been aged.

## Types of Cheese

There are many types of cheese, with around 500 different varieties recognized by the International Dairy Federation:

- **Hard cheeses** - such as Parmesan, Cheddar, Gouda
- **Soft cheeses** - such as Brie, Camembert
- **Blue cheeses** - such as Roquefort, Stilton, Gorgonzola
- **Fresh cheeses** - such as Mozzarella, Ricotta, Cottage cheese
