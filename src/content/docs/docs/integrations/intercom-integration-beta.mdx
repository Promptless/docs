**Used for: Triggers**

Promptless integrates with Intercom to enable automated documentation updates based on support conversations and repeated customer questions.

## Installation

1. Click "Connect Intercom" from the [integrations page](https://app.gopromptless.ai/integrations).
2. Review and approve the requested permissions.
3. Verify that Intercom is connected in the integrations page.

## Authentication Model

Promptless uses OAuth-based authentication for Intercom integrations, which provides:

- Secure token-based authentication
- Granular API access scopes
- Ability to revoke access at any time
- Regular token rotation for enhanced security

## What You Can Do with Intercom

Once connected, you can use Intercom as a [trigger source](/docs/configuring-promptless/triggers/intercom-tickets-beta) to monitor support conversations for documentation gaps (Beta).
