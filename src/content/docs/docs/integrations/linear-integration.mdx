## Authentication Model

Promptless uses OAuth 2.0 to authenticate with Linear, following their [official Linear OAuth 2.0 specification](https://developers.linear.app/docs/oauth/authentication). This ensures:

- Secure token-based authentication
- Ability to revoke access at any time
- Granular permission control at the team level
- Regular token rotation for enhanced security

## What You Can Do with Linear

Once connected, you can use Linear as a [context source](/docs/configuring-promptless/context-sources/linear) to search for related issues and project management data that enhances documentation accuracy.
