### User Roles

Promptless supports different user roles with varying levels of access:

</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Editor" type="role">

## Domain Verification and Auto-Enrollment

### Setting Up Automatic Team Member Joining

You can add domains to your organization to streamline the process of adding new members with email addresses from your company domain. When a verified domain is added, users with email addresses from that domain can join your organization based on your selected enrollment mode.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Click on your organization name in the upper left corner of the dashboard
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Select "Manage" from the dropdown menu
  </Step>
  <Step>
    In the "Verified domains" section, click "Add domain"

    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Enter your domain (e.g., "yourcompany.com") and click "Save"
  </Step>
  <Step>
    After verification, you'll be prompted to select an enrollment mode:

    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click "Save" to apply your selected enrollment mode
  </Step>
