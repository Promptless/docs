Doc Collections are the platforms where your documentation lives. Whether you're using Git-synced platforms such as Fern, Mintlify, or Docusaurus, or standalone platforms such as Zendesk and Intercom, you'll need to configure Promptless to read from and publish to your existing docs.

## Git-hosted Documentation Platforms

The most common setup uses GitHub repositories to store documentation content that syncs to hosting providers. A list of platforms supported through GitHub integration:

- Fern
- Mintlify
- ReadMe (Refactored)
- GitBook
- Docusaurus
- MkDocs
- Hugo
- Ghost
- Nextra
- Vocs
- Custom platforms as long as the content is in a repo

## Direct Platform Integrations

For teams using content management systems that don't sync with GitHub, Promptless offers direct integrations with popular platforms.

    Help center articles and knowledge base content management
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Intercom" icon="fa-solid fa-comments" href="/docs/configuring-promptless/doc-collections/intercom-beta">
    Customer support documentation and help center content
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Multi-Platform Publishing

Promptless can publish to multiple documentation locations simultaneously, allowing you to use the same trigger events and context sources across different platforms.

<Tip>
For teams using multiple platforms, create separate projects for each documentation location to maintain clear separation of content and workflows.
