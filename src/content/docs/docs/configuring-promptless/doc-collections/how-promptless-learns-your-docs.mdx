Before creating the first suggestion, Promptless analyzes your existing docs to understand the product, writing style, and how your docs are organized.

### Initial Ingestion

- Builds a searchable index to find relevant content when analyzing triggers
- Maps relationships between pages, sections, and topics

### Product Ontology

Promptless builds an understanding of your product's structure - what features you have, how they relate to each other, and the terminology your team uses. This **product ontology** helps Promptless:

- Know which documentation pages are relevant when a specific feature changes
- Understand your product's concepts and terminology
- Identify connections between features that might require coordinated documentation updates

For example, if your product has a "Workspaces" feature with sub-features like "Permissions" and "Invitations," Promptless understands these relationships and can update all relevant pages when workspace behavior changes.

### Voice and Style Learning

Promptless analyzes how your documentation is written - tone, sentence structure, formatting patterns, and terminology choices. This powers **Voice Match**, ensuring suggestions sound like they were written by your team.

Promptless learns patterns like:

- Whether you write formally or conversationally
- The specific words and phrases you use for concepts
- How you organize content, use headings, and format examples
- Your preferences for capitalization, punctuation, and code formatting

When drafting content, Promptless references similar existing pages to match their style.

### Continuous Learning

Promptless continues learning as you use it. When you edit suggestions or provide feedback, Promptless learns your preferences for future suggestions. As your documentation grows and changes, Promptless adapts to your evolving style and automatically re-indexes when you publish updates to stay current.
