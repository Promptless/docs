Zendesk integration enables publishing documentation updates directly to your Zendesk Help Center. This is useful for teams who manage customer-facing documentation through Zendesk's content management system.

## How It Works

When Zendesk is configured as a documentation platform:

1. **Review Suggestions**: Review documentation changes in the Promptless dashboard
2. **Publish to Zendesk**: Click "Save All & Update Zendesk" to publish approved changes
3. **Help Center Updates**: Content is created or updated in your Zendesk Help Center
4. **Customer Access**: Updated articles are immediately available to your customers

## Publishing Options

When publishing to Zendesk, you can:

- **Create New Articles**: Add new help center articles and knowledge base content
- **Update Existing Articles**: Modify existing content with new information
- **Manage Article Metadata**: Update titles, descriptions, tags, and categories
- **Add Images**: Include screenshots and diagrams in your help center content

## Project Setup

Configure Zendesk as your documentation platform in your [project settings](https://app.gopromptless.ai/projects):

1. Select Zendesk as your publishing destination
2. Configure which categories or sections to publish to
3. Set notification preferences

## Use Cases

Zendesk as a documentation platform is especially useful for:

- **Customer Support Knowledge Base**: Maintain help center articles based on actual customer questions
- **Support Ticket Deflection**: Update documentation to reduce recurring support requests
- **Customer-Facing Documentation**: Manage end-user documentation outside of technical docs
- **FAQ Management**: Keep frequently asked questions up-to-date

## Setup Instructions

To connect Zendesk to Promptless, see the [Zendesk Integration](/docs/integrations/zendesk-integration) setup guide.
