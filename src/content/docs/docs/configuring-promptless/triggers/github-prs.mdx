Promptless automatically monitors your GitHub repositories for new pull requests. When a PR is opened, the system analyzes the changes to determine if documentation updates are needed.

## How It Works

When a pull request is opened in your monitored repositories:

1. **Automatic Detection**: Promptless receives notification of the new PR
2. **Analysis**: The system processes the code diff, PR title, and PR description to understand the context
3. **Relevance Assessment**: Promptless determines if the changes require documentation updates
4. **Suggestion Creation**: If relevant, Promptless creates documentation suggestions

<Note>
Information from PRs is processed in real-time and not stored by Promptless. The analysis happens only when the PR is created or updated.
</Note>

## Configuration

Configure GitHub PR triggers in your [project settings](https://app.gopromptless.ai/projects):

1. Select GitHub as your trigger source
2. Choose which repositories to monitor
3. Optionally configure directory-specific triggers (see below)
4. Set auto-publish preferences

## Directory-Specific Triggers

You can configure Promptless to only trigger when changes are made to specific directories within your repositories. This is particularly useful when you want to focus documentation updates on changes to certain parts of your codebase.

To set up directory-specific triggers:

1. When creating or editing a project, select the GitHub trigger option
2. Check the "Choose specific directories to trigger this project" option
3. Enter the directory paths you want to monitor, separating multiple paths with commas
4. Save your project configuration

</Frame>

When trigger directories are specified, only PRs that contain changes to those directories will be considered, and updates to other files will be ignored.

## Repository Topics

If you have many repositories, you can use GitHub topics to control which ones trigger Promptless. This is especially helpful for organizations with dozens or hundreds of repos where only some need documentation automation.

1. **Tag your repositories in GitHub**: Add topics to the repositories you want Promptless to monitor (e.g., "docs-watch", "promptless"). To add topics to a repository, go to the repository's main page and click "Add topics" in the About section.

2. **Configure your project**: When creating or editing a GitHub project, check the "Trigger on repos with certain topics" option and enter the topic(s) you want to monitor. You can specify multiple topics, and Promptless will trigger on any repository that has at least one of those topics.

3. **Manage through GitHub**: To add a new repository to Promptless, tag it with the configured topic in GitHub. To remove a repository, remove the topic from the repository settings.

<Info>
Learn more about GitHub repository topics in the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics).

## Auto-publish Mode

When auto-publish is enabled for your project:
- Promptless automatically creates a new PR in your documentation repository with suggested changes
- The documentation PR is linked in a comment on the original code PR

## Draft Pull Requests

<Warning>
Promptless automatically skips draft pull requests. Documentation updates are only triggered when the pull request is marked as ready for review.
</Warning>

## Setup Instructions

To connect GitHub to Promptless, see the [GitHub Integration](/docs/integrations/github-integration) setup guide.
