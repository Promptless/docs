Promptless helps open source projects keep documentation in sync with fast-moving codebases. Use it to automatically update developer docs, generate changelogs for new releases, or handle translations.

<Success title="Open-Source Program" icon="fa-solid fa-heart">
Promptless is free for CNCF, Linux Foundation, and other eligible non-commercial open-source projects. Contact us at help@gopromptless.ai to get started.

Open source workflows sometimes differ from commercial software. We've built features and setup guides tailored specifically for open source maintainers.

## Quick Start

The basic setup for your open source project involves three steps:

<section id="promptless-oss-quick-start" class="pl-site-steps is-compact" data-sticky-heading="false">
  <div class="pl-site-step-list">
    <article class="pl-site-step" id="install-the-github-app">
      <span class="pl-site-step-num">1</span>
      <h3>Install the GitHub App</h3>
      <p>
        Connect GitHub from the <a href="https://app.gopromptless.ai/integrations">Integrations page</a>.
        You&apos;ll choose which repositories Promptless can access.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Which GitHub app should you install?</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Standard GitHub app</strong>: If you can install apps with write permissions,
          Promptless creates branches and PRs directly on your repo.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>GitHub OSS app (read-only)</strong>: If you can only install read-only apps, Promptless creates
          PRs from a fork. See the <a href="/docs/integrations/github-integration">GitHub integration docs</a> for
          details.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </article>

    <article class="pl-site-step" id="set-up-doc-collections">
      <span class="pl-site-step-num">2</span>
      <h3>Set Up Doc Collections</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="/docs/configuring-promptless/doc-collections">Doc Collections</a> tell Promptless where your
        documentation lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can create multiple doc collections if needed, for example, if your changelog is in a different location
        from your main docs. You can also specify a particular directory if your docs live in a monorepo alongside
        your code.
      </p>
      <p>
        See
        <a href="/docs/configuring-promptless/doc-collections/git-hub-repos-docs-as-code">
          GitHub Repos (Docs as Code)
        </a>
        for setup instructions.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="pl-site-step" id="create-a-project">
      <span class="pl-site-step-num">3</span>
      <h3>Create a Project</h3>
      <p>
        Create a project from the <a href="https://app.gopromptless.ai/projects">Projects page</a> to connect your
        triggers and doc collections.
      </p>
      <p>
        When creating projects, configure which repos Promptless listens to for PRs and which doc collections to
        update.
      </p>
      <Tip>
        Enable <strong>Replay recent PRs</strong> to run Promptless on your last 30 days of PRs. This gives you an
        initial batch of suggestions to calibrate with before going live.
      </Tip>
      <p>
        Many open source projects prefer to centralize operations in GitHub so anyone can benefit from Promptless
        without needing an account. If this applies to you, enable <strong>Auto-create PR</strong> so suggestions
        automatically become pull requests. We recommend turning this on after your initial calibration is complete,
        so that you&apos;re able to refine Promptless&apos;s configuration before rolling it out to all contributors.

## Recommended Trigger Configuration

Most projects trigger Promptless on opened PRs. For popular open source projects—where many contributor PRs get closed without merging—consider using [GitHub Commit triggers](/docs/configuring-promptless/triggers/git-hub-commits) instead. This way, Promptless only runs when PRs are actually merged to your default branch. We recommend changing this setting after your initial calibration.

## Additional Use Cases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Translation workflows" defaultOpen={true}>
    For translation workflows, you might want the trigger to be the English directory of your docs. Promptless will then draft updates that translate content to the rest of your documentation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="GitHub Issues integration" defaultOpen={true}>
    If GitHub Issues are part of your workflow, create a GitHub Issues trigger so contributors can tag Promptless in issues to generate doc updates.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Updating Contributor PRs (coming soon)" defaultOpen={true}>
    For some monorepo use cases, you might want Promptless to add a docs commit to your contributors' existing PRs rather than create separate docs PRs. If you're interested in this feature, contact us at help@gopromptless.ai.

    Note: this is not compatible with the read-only version of the Promptless Github app.
