After Promptless opens a docs PR, you can provide follow-on instructions directly through GitHub comments. Promptless automatically handles quality issues (like linter failures, Vale warnings, or broken links) that arise in documentation PRs, so manual feedback can focus on content improvements rather than technical fixes.

## Comment trigger modes

Configure how Promptless responds to comments on documentation PRs:

**Listen to all comments** (default for new organizations): Promptless processes all human comments on documentation PRs automatically. To have Promptless ignore a specific comment, start it with `aside` or `/aside`.

**Require @promptless mentions** (default for existing organizations): Promptless only responds when you tag @promptless in a comment.

<Info>
Change this setting anytime in [Settings → Org Settings](https://app.gopromptless.ai/settings).

## Reviewing in the dashboard

Every PR that Promptless opens includes a dashboard link at the top of the description for additional context.

When you click the dashboard link, you can:

- **View citations**: See the exact GitHub files, PRs, and commits Promptless referenced
- **Read the reasoning process**: Understand why Promptless made specific updates
- **Review full context**: Access all source material Promptless analyzed, including Slack threads, issue tickets, and related conversations

Use the dashboard to verify updates or understand the background behind changes.

## Two ways of providing feedback

### 1. Individual comments

Leave individual comments on specific lines or sections of the documentation PR for targeted feedback.

If your organization uses **Listen to all comments** mode, just leave your comment—Promptless will process it automatically. In **Require @promptless mentions** mode, tag @promptless in the comment (it won't show up in auto-complete, but Promptless will still see it).

Promptless automatically reads all previous comments in the PR to understand the full context. This means your instructions can be as simple as "Same here" or "Apply this change to the other section too."

### 2. PR reviews

Start a review to provide multiple pieces of feedback that Promptless can handle all at once.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start a Review">
    Click "Review changes" to begin a formal review process, or select "Start a review" when adding an in-line comment.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Multiple Comments">
    Continue adding comments as part of the review.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Submit Your Review">
    Click "Finish your review" and submit. In **Listen to all comments** mode, Promptless processes the review automatically. In **Require @promptless mentions** mode, tag @promptless in the review summary.
  </Step>
</Steps>
