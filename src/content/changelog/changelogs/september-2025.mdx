**Improvements:**

* **Enhanced Slack Context Understanding:** Promptless now analyzes full Slack conversations instead of individual messages, capturing surrounding discussion for more accurate and comprehensive documentation.

* **Enhanced GitHub PR Comment Context Awareness:** When you tag Promptless in GitHub PR comments, it reads all previous comments to understand full context. Use simple instructions like "Same here" or "Apply this change to the other section too" without repeating details.

* **GitBook Platform Support:** Promptless now supports GitBook as a first-class documentation platform. Connect your repositories to automatically update GitBook documentation when code changes.

* **Improved Jira Context Integration:** Promptless now more reliably fetches Jira ticket information when issues are mentioned in pull requests. Full ticket context including descriptions, comments, and related issues is consistently retrieved.

* **Automated CI Check and Build Issue Resolution:** Promptless automatically detects and fixes quality issues in documentation PRs. When linters fail, Vale rules trigger, or build errors occur, Promptless analyzes and pushes fixes to the PR branch automatically.

* **Smart Draft State Management for Documentation PRs:** Documentation PRs now open as drafts when the source code PR hasn't merged yet, then automatically switch to "Ready for Review" once the source PR merges. This means your team only reviews documentation changes after the underlying code is finalized.

* **Improved Dashboard Synchronization for Follow-on Suggestions:** The dashboard now immediately reflects changes when you make follow-on suggestions. No more delays—instant updates for better real-time visibility.

* **PR Open Status Filter:** You can now filter for suggestions published as pull requests directly from the status dropdown. Previously, you had to manually type `is:pr_open` into the search bar. The "PR Open" option appears alongside "Ready," "Published," and "Rejected."
