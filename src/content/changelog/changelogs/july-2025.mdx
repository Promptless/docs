**What's New:**

* **PR Replay:** New GitHub projects can now process the last 30 days of PRs during setup. This catches you up on recent changes and generates documentation suggestions for anything you might have missed.

* **All Repos Trigger:** Check "Trigger on all repos" when setting up GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket projects to automatically monitor all your repositories. No need to manually select each one, and new repos get included automatically.

**Improvements:**

* **Better PR Reviews:** When you submit a "Request changes" review on a Promptless PR, we'll process all your comments automatically—no need to @mention us in each one.

* **Smarter GitHub Comments:** Promptless now react with 👀 when processing your comments, reply in threads instead of cluttering the main conversation, and mention you directly in our responses.
