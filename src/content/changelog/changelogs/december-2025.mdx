**What's New:**

* **Promptless Capture:** Keeps product screenshots in your documentation current. Promptless audits your existing screenshots on day one, regenerates outdated ones, then continuously monitors your codebase for UI changes. When code changes impact a screenshot, Promptless detects which screenshots need updating and recreates them with your current UI. Review and iterate on regenerated screenshots in the dashboard.

* **Screenshot Editor:** Edit screenshots generated by Promptless directly in the dashboard. Click any image in the Created Assets section to crop, add annotations, highlight UI elements, adjust framing, or insert shapes, text, and arrows—save your edits and the updated image is immediately available.

* **Repository Topic Filtering for GitHub Triggers:** Filter which repositories trigger Promptless using GitHub topics. Tag your repositories with a topic like "docs-enabled" or "promptless", then configure your Promptless project to monitor that topic. Add new repos to Promptless by tagging them in GitHub—no need to update your Promptless configuration.

* **Commit Trigger Replay:** New GitHub projects configured with Commit triggers can now process the last 30 days of direct commits during setup. This catches you up on recent changes and generates documentation suggestions for anything you might have missed.

* **Improved Project Settings Editing:** Save empty documentation directories to scan your entire repository, and switch GitHub organizations when editing projects. When you change your documentation directory scope, Promptless automatically closes suggestions containing files outside the new scope—keeping your staging area clean.

* **Automatic Suggestion Updates on PR Merge:** When a GitHub PR merges, Promptless automatically updates existing documentation suggestions to reflect what actually merged. If your PR changed during code review—code updates, description edits, or new commits—your doc suggestions stay accurate.

* **Markdown Support in Suggestion Descriptions:** Suggestion descriptions in the dashboard now render with full markdown formatting—bold and italic text, code snippets, links, and structured lists.

* **Protected Branch Detection for Slack Notifications:** When Promptless detects protected branches in your documentation repository, Slack notifications show "Open PR" or "View PR" buttons instead of "Publish." This prevents merge errors for repositories that require PR reviews before merging.

* **Auto-Publish Support for GitHub Commit and MS Teams Triggers:** GitHub Commit and MS Teams triggers now support auto-publish mode. When enabled, Promptless automatically creates documentation PRs as soon as suggestions are ready, streamlining your review and publishing workflow.

* **Auto-Merge for Documentation PRs:** Promptless now automatically merges documentation PRs as soon as they're created when auto-publish is enabled. Enable "Automatically merge Promptless's suggestions into the default branch" in project settings (nested under auto-publish) for complete end-to-end automation—from code changes to merged documentation—ideal for internal docs or teams with high confidence in Promptless suggestions.

* **Citations Button Always Available:** The Show Citations button in the file diff viewer now remains visible and enabled whenever citations exist for a file. Previously, this button was incorrectly disabled after opening a PR or publishing a suggestion, making it difficult to view source references.

* **Sign Out During Onboarding:** Users can now sign out from the onboarding screen. This fixes an issue where users were stuck if they accidentally signed in with the wrong email address.
