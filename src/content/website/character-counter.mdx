## What is Character Counter?

Character Counter is a free online tool that displays the character count, word count, sentence count, paragraph count, and line count for any text you type or paste. Results update instantly as you write.

## Target length

Set a target length and any characters beyond the limit are highlighted in red directly in the text area. Common limits to try:

| Platform | Element | Limit |
|---|---|---|
| Google Ads | Headline | 30 |
| Google Ads | Description | 90 |
| Instagram | Bio | 150 |
| SMS | Single message | 160 |
| Search engines | Meta description | 155–160 |
| X / Twitter | Post | 280 |
| Instagram | Caption | 2,200 |
| LinkedIn | Post | 3,000 |

## Why character count matters

**Social media** — Twitter limits posts to 280 characters. Instagram bios cap at 150. Knowing your count before posting prevents truncated messages.

**SEO** — Meta descriptions display roughly 155–160 characters in search results. Titles show about 50–60. Staying within these ranges keeps your snippets intact on Google.

**Advertising** — Google Ads headlines allow 30 characters; descriptions allow 90. Every character counts when you're paying per click.

**Messaging** — A single SMS segment is 160 characters using GSM encoding. Exceeding this splits the message and may increase cost.

**Academic and professional writing** — Assignments, resumes, and cover letters often specify character or word limits. Meeting them shows attention to detail.
